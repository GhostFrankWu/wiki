# SageMathCell

SageMathCell project is an easy-to-use web interface to a free open-source mathematics software system SageMath. You can help SageMath by becoming a sponsor.

It allows embedding Sage computations into any webpage: check out our short instructions, a comprehensive description of capabilities, or Notebook Player to convert Jupyter notebooks into dynamic HTML pages!

Resources for your computation are provided by Departamento de Matemáticas, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid. You can also set up your own server.
