## Description

If I told you a word started with 0x70 in hexadecimal, what would it start with in ASCII?

## Hints

Submit your answer in our flag format. For example, if your answer was 'hello', you would submit 'picoCTF{hello}' as the flag.

## Solution

We are given a hexadecimal value and asked the convert it to ASCII. The easiest way to go around this is to just put it through a hex-to-ascii conversion online site such as [RapidTables](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/ascii-hex-bin-dec-converter.html).

## Flag

```
picoCTF{p}
```
