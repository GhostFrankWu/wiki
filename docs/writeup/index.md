# Writeups

Writeups are **solutions** to the CTF challenges. Each writeup contains several components: 

* Challenge description and attachments of challenge.
* Analysis of the challenge. Make a brief introduction to the idea of solution.
* Steps to solve the question and the example code of the exploit.
* Result from the challenge output.
* References and related websites the attack methods and methodology of the exploit.

Some writeups are from cooperators of our team and website.

## Usage of the writeups

Here are some ideas that may help you to use the writeups.

First of all, if writeup's idea of solving challenge doesn't clear enough, feel free to add more content to the writeup. Some additional steps are also fine. You can use the methodology of writeup to solve the challenge, but <u>don't forget to read about the ideas and references of attack after the solution</u>.

Please don't simple copy the flag and submit it to the judger. Sometimes the flag is dynamic and every time you request the challenge it would change. If you submit a out dated flag or others flag, your account may be **banned**.

Only watch writeup if you can not find any method to solve the challenge.

Enjoy your trip!
