The link goes to something that looks like this:

[![home page](https://github.com/vivian-dai/PicoCTF2021-Writeup/raw/main/Web%20Exploitation/Cookies/home.png)](https://github.com/vivian-dai/PicoCTF2021-Writeup/blob/main/Web Exploitation/Cookies/home.png)

I typed in "snickerdoodle" and entered it.

> I love snickerdoodle cookies!

Ctrl + Shift + I will reveal some things, navigate to storage, then find cookies storage.

I noticed there's a grand total of one cookie with a value of 0. I changed the value to 1 and refreshed the page.

> I love chocolate chip cookies!

I kept increasing the numeric value of value by 1 until at 18, it gave the flag: [![flag](https://github.com/vivian-dai/PicoCTF2021-Writeup/raw/main/Web%20Exploitation/Cookies/flag.png)](https://github.com/vivian-dai/PicoCTF2021-Writeup/blob/main/Web Exploitation/Cookies/flag.png)
