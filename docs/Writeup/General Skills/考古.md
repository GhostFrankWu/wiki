## Solution

Windows system image forensics.

The given memory file is a Windows XP SP3 image file.

Using `volatility` to find information in the image, the followings are important:

```
1. consoles
	Gives some information about hacked by 1cepeak.
2. pslist
	Find 2 processes, Oneclickcleanup & DumpIt
3. filescan
	Find the Oneclickcleanup.exe
```

We should know that `DumpIt` is the process used to create system image, and this is not related to the solution.

Then we should reverse `Oneclickcleanup.exe` and find the next step.

First, we find a key `this_a_key`. The process uses this key to encrypt data.

We get yet another file using reverse.

The given file is a `doc` file with `MS Word 6.0`. An old version of document. After the scan and analysis, no macro is found in the doc file, and as well as the hidden character.

After struggling several hours, I happened checked the `xor brute force` of the file, and I found something interesting.

This part of the document can be `xor` using key `0x2d` and gives the flag.
