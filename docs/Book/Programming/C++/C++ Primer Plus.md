New C++11 Coverage

*C++ Primer Plus* is a carefully crafted, complete tutorial on one of the most significant and widely used programming languages today. An accessible and easy-to-use self-study guide, this book is appropriate for both serious students of programming as well as developers already proficient in other languages.

The sixth edition of *C++ Primer Plus* has been updated and expanded to cover the latest developments in C++, including a detailed look at the new C++11 standard.

Review questions and programming exercises at the end of each chapter help readers zero in on the most critical information and digest the most difficult concepts.
