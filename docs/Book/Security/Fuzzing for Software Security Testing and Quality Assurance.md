## Introduction

Learn the code cracker's malicious mindset, so you can find worn-size holes in the software you are designing, testing, and building. Fuzzing for Software Security Testing and Quality Assurance takes a weapon from the black-hat arsenal to give you a powerful new tool to build secure, high-quality software. This practical resource helps you add extra protection without adding expense or time to already tight schedules and budgets. The book shows you how to make fuzzing a standard practice that integrates seamlessly with all development activities. This comprehensive reference goes through each phase of software development and points out where testing and auditing can tighten security. It surveys all popular commercial fuzzing tools and explains how to select the right one for a software development project. The book also identifies those cases where commercial tools fall short and when there is a need for building your own fuzzing tools.
